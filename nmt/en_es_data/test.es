Yeah. Wow.
And you want me to come with you.
I will stay here and run things on this end.
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Screwed.
What
This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
That's OK.
The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
[anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
That's great. [Meredith scowls]
Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
Really? Well, I hope I do.
Oh zip it.
Michael Scott. [sticks out hand for handshake]
You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
What's up buddy?
Guilty, yeah.
Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.
What? You like Jan? How can you
You hooked up with Jan?
Yeah, let's change the subject.
Nice to meet you.
OK, Michael.
What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]
[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]
NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
Surely, you cannot be serious?
You understand this is a very serious situation.
You made a joke?
Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Oh.
Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]
Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.
Cool.
I'm not good with names.
Yes, sure. Mr. Scott, you can head to the conference room. The other managers are already there.
All right.
Hey Scott. Hey. Hey! Hey! Come here! Come here! I want to talk to you. Come here!
They are either going to say yes... or no.
Think it through.
Can we not?
Still want that.
Fumble! Yaaah!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Yeah.
I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Ha! I don't get it.
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
I can't do this.
Oh, okay.
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
I'll try and think of one. When...
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
Saleswoman has a vagina.
But I'm right?
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
Could I have a copy of one of them?
No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
Yeah!
Unbelievable.
That is so great about the bonus!
This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Michael?
You said we were getting bonuses.
Cancel wallpaper.
You mean Toastmasters?
Can I go?
Been to Amsterdam.
Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
Michael, can you explain?
Well, it's mostly made up. So...
Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
I'll glance at it.
Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
[polite clapping]
No, I can't... I ca...
[claps]
I know what I said.
I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?
[clapping]
Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
What? Something happened?
Weird.
Con artist.
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
It is?
What is?
I don't follow.
Oh, God!
Well, that didn't go well.
No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
Her nephew's in Iraq.
Yes, but they are both in danger.
Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Way to go, Ryan!
Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...
Yeah, sure.
Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
I reminded you last night.
Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still.
Don't you think you should say something?
Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
[in unison] That's Batman.
The ocean.
Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
I'm in eighth grade.
She's in middle school.
Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Let's start with... your mom.
Sasha.
Ooh! [picks up train whistle]
Sure. [Sasha blows into whistle continously]
[plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
There's a photo...
These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
What's a Nazi?
[standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...
...from the 1930's...
I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Bye, Mister Poop.
[raising hands] I do, I do!
You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
That's not fair. [the rest of the kids agree]
You're just a middleman.
Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?
We have better service than they do!
That is correct.
Hi kids.
Ewwww!
Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
No way.
Really?
What?!
Right. Okay.
You know, I can go with him.
No! I will... go.
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
[to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
[from TV] ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in? [TV children cheer] Let's have some fun!
Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
That's pretty funny.
Is that Chet Montgomery?
[employees chuckle] And he
Okay, next? So, whats your name?
Hi everyone, it's one of my favorite times of the day.
Did you get married?
Why not?
So, do you have any kids?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?
Even I have a girlfriend.
So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be.
Meredith!
I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Is everything okay?
Uh... it's true...
Mmhmm.
Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
Not Jan.
If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
Somehow.
Yes.
I know.
Niiice.
Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
I got some muscles. You wanna see the muscles? Bam! Look at that.
Man, you have got to be kidding me.
Can I have a quarter? I promise I'll pay you back.
Can I have a dollar? Then I can buy chips and a drink.
Who is this guy again?
Who uses calling cards anymore?
This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Happy birthday Michael.
I said happy birthday.
Thank you! That's really nice.
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
No. I'm still waiting.
Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
Birthday hug!
That suit is amazing.
Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
No. This is a closed door meeting.
Michael, I have Jan on the line.
Hello, Michael.
I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Well, today's not my birthday, so...
...Happy birthday, Michael.
Am I on camera?
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up]
[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.
Mmhmm, happy birthday.
Who brought in donuts?
Happy birthday!
I... guess I forgot.
Are you serious?
Hi, delivery for Michael Scott.
Uh... s-sure.
Oh. Thanks.
When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
I probably care more than she does.
Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
...I'll do it.
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Happy birth moment, Michael.
One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
Here they come.
Come and get it!
Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
These are all the same?
Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
No.
No.
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
Hello? Hey.
No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
Here we go. Make a wish.
Yaoo yay! [claps]
Pam was supposed to get 'em.
No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
[to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
Still scary.
Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
I work here.
If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
You... owe me.
Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
How dare you sir. You are gross.
I'll get someone to take it down.
Is that Michael?
I got it.
I can't relax about it, you know?
No, not yet.
Okay, Michael.
Michael?
Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
No just the front two.
Sure.
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].
This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
Turn it around. Turn it around.
Number one!!
Michael?
This is from all of us.
Let's get the party started.
Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.'
I won't.
Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
No, I think you're gonna stay.
To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
Hey. I got the information.
[turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
[looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
...What?
I almost died.
You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
What?
Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
...It doesn't apply.
Quit it!
...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
[on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Michael.
What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
Has anyone ever come back?
How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
...What?
By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
[locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax...
But in the big picture...
...It wasn't personal.
Pack my--?
Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Thanks for coming.
Oh, Michael.
Yep.
What do you mean?
Um... you wanna buy it?
Uh-huh.
[hugs Michael] ... Thank you.
Do you have something in your pocket?
No thank you.
Okay.
I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
What are you reading?
Oh, that could be interesting.
[clears throat] I am ready.
Five.
Hmm... Five.
Yeah.
[still laughing] I know.
Michael it's not... It's not...
That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.
I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.
How have you adopted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Just following up on that first question...
OK.
New question.
In the digital age...
... email...
Do you believe your high fixed cost are warranted given your diminishing market share.
Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
And now, the chains.
A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]
Is everything ok, Michael?
Yes.
I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
[trumpet sounds]
It's early bird gets the worm.
Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh. Um. I think we're good.
Thanks for inviting me along.
Michael?
Hi.
Let's just blow this party off.
Am I on speaker phone?
Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Still on speaker?
Are camera's there?
See you soon.
Talk to you later, Jan.
I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
Salad.
You dressed exactly like the servants.
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
That would have been really embarrassing.
Crisis averted.
Oscar. Angela.
Hi.
Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
It's from both of us.
Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.
Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
I've never told you that I love you.
What's this over the 'i'?
Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
Hello Michael.
From the Scranton Branch.
Excuse me.
So did the merger go smoothly, or?
I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Can I get anyone anything, or?
Martini please.
Does that include the garage?
It's a common question.
This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
You ok?
Sure.
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
It's nice.
I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Oh.
I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Don't you know what I'm doing?
Shut up.
Come on.
What?
Just let me loosen my dress.
Michael.
Slam me up against the wall, right here.
Oh, please.
Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad?
Damn jet skis!
I feel sick.
No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Please don't cry.
It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
I didn't mean it. I was...
Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
[sigh] Is Toby there?
Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
What did I tell you about 'yeppers?'
I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
[flustered] Well... good for Dwight.
Where'd you get that?
Wikipedia.
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
I can't hear you.
Still nothin'.
No.
Nice.
Okay.
And what happens in this one?
Okay.
Can I have a raise?
[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
What?
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
You ready for me?
Cool.
Okay.
No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off.
Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
Are you wearin' lady clothes?
Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
That there's a woman's suit.
I'ma call Roy, man.
This is gonna make him feel better.
This is too good.
You're wearing a woman's suit?
No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
Who makes it?
Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Did you see...
So, none of that tipped you off?
Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
[Laughing, covering her mouth]
Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
What?  I can't hear you.
I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.
Why can't I just... tell you?
There you go.
I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Come on, be for real Mike.
[laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this?
Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Ho-ho!
Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
Ok, let's take 15, again.
Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
Here's the $40 you gave me.
[on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
What?
That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Yeah, you should.
Fourteen years long.
Make it happen, cap'in.
Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
No, I said your idea was stupid.
Where?
Comfortable, Mike?
No.
Thank you.
I haven't been to New York in a long time.
Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Mm, it's not that big.
Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
That's my new assistant.
I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Oh, God.
Michael---
Michael---
[under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...
Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
What's wrong with you?
Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
No.  But we can offer you 12.
But you just said 15.
I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Damn you.
Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
Should you drive the forklift?
It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Madge.
No, it's always been Madge.
Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Do you understand that?
We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
What the
Don't disrespect the baler!
No do not touch it!
There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
Take them at the same time.
You know, anything that warms you.
Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?
Actually, you did.
Sedentary.
That's called having a fat butt, Michael.
Yeah, yeah.  That's, that's fat butt disease.  That's what you suffer from?
Alright, we outta here.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
Okay.
I don't understand the question.
Yeah...
It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
So, you're okay?
Indubitably.
Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
Wolves.
Visual aids.
No time to sew a quilt.  ... I got it.  Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.
[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
We measured it once...
Seedless?
Ready?
[drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
Okay.
Got it.
We're not allowed to use the baler.
Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
Yeah!
[imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
[singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
[singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
[singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
[outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
[on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Is that the last year the data was available?
Don't do anything rash!
I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
you said to just...
Okay, I'm on it!
Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Michael!  What's wrong?
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Come down and... open it and you'll see.
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Way
Come down, okay?
Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
[walks around Andy's new car keying it]
I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.
Come on.
Step lively. Single file everybody.
Let's single...
Single... OK.
Screw you.
Sir, could you please, please focus on Darryl?
Summing up.
Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.
[sighs]
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
Right.
Argh!
Ghaaa!
You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.
How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Yes bosses.
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
Jimbo!
[impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy!
Ayyyy!
Ayyyy!
That was funny.
That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
I miss Stacy.
So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]
Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
They're for her to look at, Michael.
Yes, let's have a word.
Oh, I'm sorry.
So sexy it becomes hostile.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
We do.
You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
That sounds fun.
Yeah, deal with it Pam!
I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
You're gonna need to lie down right over here.
Hi, I cant talk right now.  I'm sorry.
Whew, I'm really nervous.
Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up.
Whew, it's better for me just to be quiet, yeah.
Sure.
Sorry, it's the other thing I do when I get really nervous.
Alright, here we go.
Just relax.
Oh, that's gross.
We're in.
What?
Ew.
That's not good.
Well, ok... bags! [Michael is taken aback] Alright, that was bad.
Um, a hat.
A hat with no blood in it?
You're cute.
You're done.
Ah, we did it!
Is he OK?
What?
Oh.  She left.
Oh yeah, I understood.
Well, his heart was in the right place.
I don't think so.
I can't.
Was he in to you in like a gay way?
He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
I'm not done yet.
A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
I guess I have.  Huh.
He's on one of his honeymoons.
My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
A net? a giant net?
What do you have in mind?
Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
No.
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
Hey.  No movement.
Eh, its not that early.
I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Oh.  Meh.
Eh.
Hello.
Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
Oh, hi! I'm Lynn.
Hi.
I'm from here!
I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
I am.
Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Hey, it just takes one!
You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
She could be.
Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl]
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Thanks, Michael.
We can stay a little longer.
Michael, it's time.
Come on, we'll all go.
[after some encouragement] OK.
[on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.
[on the phone] Sure. Uh huh.
I'm on the phone.
[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
[sighs] Who's there?
Buddha who?
Great.
Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
I got a knock-knock joke.
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
[clears throat] Knock, knock.
KGB.
[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Ding Dong.
KGB.
I'm not answering it.
I'm not answering that. You answer it.
[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Jelly beans.
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
Free paper.'
Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
[on phone] I'll take that down right now.
I'm on the phone.
[on phone] Hold on one second.
[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Ten percent?
They're our largest client.
How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
OK...
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
Start over.
Were the boxes near each other?
I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
They can.
Yes, they can.
Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
That's not why.
Good one.
I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
[on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
Fine. What is going on?
Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
How could you not know Michael?
Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
Michael?
Was it the sales department?
Was it Jim?
OK, was it Dwight?
[long pause] Yes.
That was your idea.
You did. Several times. Over and over again.
[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
You don't keep a diary.
Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
To keep secrets from my computer.
Impossible.
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
OK, what am I thinking right now?
No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
What about Shoe La La?
[sighs] It's not ready yet.
I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
These aren't announcements.
I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Well...
We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Try me.
I haven't made a decision yet.
No.
There it is.
That's too bad.
That's what she said! [David laughs]
Inspiration.
[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Sure.
[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
Yeah?
So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
Pam...
[on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
It is my idea.
It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
Horse Boat.
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Oh give me a break.
That's because they're easy!
Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
I am gone.
Oh I am. In my own words.
No.
No, Michael.
Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
And of course, classy.
Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Not classy.
De class'.
Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
Yeah, are you coming out now?
I-I was-
Hey.
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
Thank you.
This is what you did last night?
Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Ni-
Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
Hey-o!
You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
That's great.
Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
[clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
You didn't tell them.
Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Fantastic.
It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
What about your party?
Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
What gave you that idea?
I see.
Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
Ask him about the party.
No the other thing.
No.
No.
Saticoy Steel.
No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
No.
Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
And what is that?
That's not how I plan on doing things.
I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Ok.
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
David Wallace's office.
Michael...
[on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
That is so unnecessary!
It's no big deal.
Thank you.
Thanks, Charles.
I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Michael?
I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Ok.
That's not the way it's gonna work.
No, it is not.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
No, seriously.
How old are you?
Five years old?
I will walk away.
Stop doing that!
And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
You pet the animals and they pet you back.
It's really just a regular shaped cake.
This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
[Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
Yep. [shuts door behind him]
[coming out from bathroom] Michael.
How did you get here, Michael?
Ok.
Michael. Listen-
Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
That's not exactly-
No.
Yes.
We didn't ask you to do that.
[out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
What?
Michael get to the good part.
At least he is in the building.
Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Did you spit in his face?
Michael is that scotch?
Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
Do you have any leads on a job?
You called any headhunters?
Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Hey Michael...
Can I talk to you a minute?
I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Ah... busted. Yes
Thank you. [to Michael] You interviewing too?
Interviewing?
Regional manager.
For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Philly.
Yeah, well this is one of the few places that's hiring.  It's uh, its brutal out there.
[overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
Thank you. [groaning ceases]
Hi, you've reached Prince Paper.  We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community we are no longer in business.  Thank you for your support. May God bless you. [girl's voice] Bye!
[sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh... [chuckles].
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
I would prefer not to.
You're starting your own paper company?
Why?
Do you know the industry is in decline?
Right.
No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Okay. [keeps eyes open]
I am not gonna do this.
And you are not going to, either.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Okay.  After you.
My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Yeah. Good.
She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
No way!?
In this climate?
Your own paper company.
Right...
What a courageous venture.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
Okay. So yeah.
You put a note in my food?
Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
Five years?
It's just not prudent Michael.
Can't you see I'm urinating?
No.
No.
No I didn't.
Okay, Michael?
I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
Okay Michael.
I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
No, no no no.  You're done, Michael.
I can't believe this is really happening.
[Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
These are for employees only.
Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
But you didn't want to start with us?
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Okay, let me know if you find it.
Michael get up!
Michael, what are you doing?
Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
Michael, wait!  I'm coming with you.
Yeah.
Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Salesman.
Still no.
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
Okay, see you later.
Ooh.
Michael.
Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam.  Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!
Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]
Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
Oh, thanks, Kelly.
Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
Agreed.
Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
Alright.
Um, stimulate the nipples.
I have a shirt like that in my car.
Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
A little frazzled.
[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
No, it's 4:35.
No, not yet, Michael.
Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Hey, are you kidding me?
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
A really awesome baby.
So let's have it at the hospital.
How are we doing on contractions?
Michael, I told you.
Jim, we waited too long!
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
I don't want to have my baby here.
The hospital.
A baby.
Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
Alright, I have my wallet.
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
There's nothing in it.
Dwight, get away!
Good luck, Pam!
Hey, it's 5:00!
Hold it!
Oh, one more!
No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!
Let's go!
[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
This is where I saw that deer last week.
Right over by that fence.
Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
Michael!
Michael, come on!
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Dwight Schrute.
Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
Yes.
Michael, just go park the car.
Sir!  You can't park here!
Okay.
Okay.
[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I'm going to go wash my eyes.
This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
This is happening!
Oh, my God.
Sir!  Sir, you can't smoke that in here.  Put it, put it out.
Okay.
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Yeah!
I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Hello, Michael.
Love you.
Love you, mom.
Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Again, no pants.
Ready?
Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
This man has a gift!
I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
Like Clooney.
Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
[in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
[as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Okay.
Michael, could I talk to you privately?
Bye.
I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
Really?
I don't want anyone to die.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
You said she liked me.
I've dumped better than Erin.
Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
I used a variation of your move.
Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
Oh good morning sweetheart.
I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
[pulls out glass cube with coal.] Is that a lump of coal?
Have I been that naughty?
Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.
Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.
Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.
I have a question.
I am so proud of Sabre's 'Print In All Colors' initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds]  Daryl?
Okay hush now.
Oh look at you.
Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!
Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away.
Well, anytime now.
Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket?
Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?
Enough!
All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
[singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...
No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
Yes it is.
How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
Not bad, huh?
I impressed her with my good ideas.
I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.
Hey there.
Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time.
Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work...
Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.
Anything else I can help you with?
Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
Hey what's up, Butt-plug?
Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves.  I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.
You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
Anything I can do for you Puddin'?
Hmm.
All right then.
Michael?
Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
[cheering Michael]
No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Oh -hoh! All right.
Whoops! [Humps Michael]
No.
Is he you?
Where did you take that?
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Sure. That they should do one.
Who's that?
John Dillinger.
Captain Crunch.
At the Yankees game. Yeah.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
...in your condo complex.
M. Night Shulman?
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
When I was asking about the leads.
... is there any news on the leads?
Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Oh, sorry, wait one second.
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
You writing your name over there?
That's good. You know, with the kid.
Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...
Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
Michael.
I know who did that.
Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
You need to get back on top.
Yeah.
Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
What'd you get?
Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
[on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
- of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
Okay, good.
Good.
Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
What are you -
They aren't salespeople!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Hey.
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
Hey, alright.
Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
I don't think you understand -
[holds up card] This one's a map.
I love you.
Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!
Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Not your staff, Michael. You.
Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
I'm not going. You did this, not us.
That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
I can't. You know that.
[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
I don't think we need opposed.
Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
Kung-fu movies!
Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
Don't do it [lobs something at Michael]
No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
Oh [half-heartedly throws something]
[beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
Hope - grows.
Good news that you found our leads?
[Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Not counting the last one, 25.
Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
Okay.
I made a sale.
What do we get if we do 'em?
And one girl push-up.
Ow!
19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Ten...
Eleven, wow!
[chanting] Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley...
Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Hey, boss man.
A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
I'm sorry, I meant later.
For happy hour?
Trying to get a head count.
All right, yes! It's a deal.
When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Easy.
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Would you like to be our fourth?
Hey, Michael.
This is my friend Julie.
Good. Hi.
So you work with Pam and Jim?
[giggles] I should hope not.
Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
I am an ESL teacher.
Yeah.
Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?'
So what do you think?
About Julie?
Yeah.
So you like her?
So Pam was right?
About you two hitting it off.
Why are you wearing a hat now?
Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
What are you doing?
Michael, you don't have to do this.
[choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
Hello.
Hi.
You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?
Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Ted, are we having fun?
We got a problem?
All right, go.
Get out. Now.
Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
You guys are stripes, I think...
It stopped.
Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Then I am sorry that I didn't kick you out.
Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir.
Is that how you do it?
Really? How much have you written?
Oh.
Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca's? It's a classic.
Dude, tonight! You're not going to want to put it down. It's gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow.
Shut up.
What's your drink?
Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
You have a card?
Stanley Hudson?
Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudson's in here.
Michael Scott?
You just won yourself a lunch.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Not at all.
After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.
Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
We'd love to see it!
You never told me you made a movie.
It's got you.
[laughs] I can't wait.
I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Or carnivals!
Uh... which part?
Some people are really popping on screen!
Hey! Good movie.
I loved it.
Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
Uhm...
Not worried about that.
Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
I'm real.
I love you too.
I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval]
[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]
Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
[laughs at the stupidity]
[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
[walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
After you!
Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
All right.
I already have.
[to Michael] Why is Packer back?
Why's he talking to Holly?
[excitedly] Oh!
Nice! We got burned!
So you know the feeling.
I didn't order anything.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Is too!
I don't wanna move desks!
Do I have any say in this?!
[to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
No! No.
Did Todd tell you to do that?
I love you.
Oh I'm going.
I don't think he's funnier than me.
No, he's not funny at all.
No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
[at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
Why?
Holly said that?
She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Don't give up on me.
I won't.
I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
[cutting in] No! Don't!
Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
He took my desk.
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
[walking into Michael's office] You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the 'ass', in Tallahassee!
Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Do you have a ball and chain?
Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
It's gonna be so good.
I'm sorry about your friend.
[Brooklyn accent] You ahh.
What ah you wicked smaht?
Who ahh?
Woah, I love her. How much for that?
10 dollars.
200
45
Damn it.
You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Well we could put it in storage... in case.
You know... in case if something changes.
How much for the slip and slide?
Get lost.
[looks out window] Michael! Michael!
Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Why do you need more gas?
Is it a good message or a bad message?
Are you proposing!?
Wow.
Yea. Yea no problem. [runs away]
Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
This is terrible.
Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
You called the meeting I don't..
I did?
Michael.
We are a family.
And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
So about this proposal thing...
So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
That's a guarantee.
Don't think you need the corpse then.
Holy s*** is that real?
No. [shakes head back and forth]
At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Totally reasonable.
She's not gonna say no.
Yeah... it.s scary.
Look I need to talk to you.
I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
Uh, what?
I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
13 dollars.
Listen about earlier ...
It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
Why?
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
I remember.
Michael.. [they both laugh]
Yes.
In-grown hair.
Mh hmm.
Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
What happened here?
Nice
[everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
Congratulations!
All of us?
Wait, what?
All right, so just you tonight?
I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.
To begginings and endings.
The moms and the troops.
[laughs] I won't... I don't know her.
Colorado! The sunshine state.
Doing some skiing?
Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess.
I'm an olympics nut.
You know, it's funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.
You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?
That's the way it goes.
Excuse me. Hello? You running late?
I'm at the bar too.
I'm at the bar. The bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel.
How long have you...
[looking up from phones in unison] Sorry...
I am wearing a grey suit, red tie.
Which place?
I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.
Deangelo Vickers.
That is insane, that is the right term. Let's get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.
I am ready.
Alright! Here we go!
I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune...
[wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
[blinds roll down, Deangelo waving]
Hello! [opens door] How are you sir?
And that is what you call a meet cute.
Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
Oh. [chuckles] That was... let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there! [office laughs]
I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
Well, it wasn't an affair.
Thanks for meeting me.
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
Oh, assist.
I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point.
And it really isn't.
Well, I'd like to change it, actually.
I think a change would be nice.
I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close.
Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it?
Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
Ok, then, powwows then, fine.
No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?
Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley!
[holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Interesting.
Best whale watching: easily the west coast. If you're going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called 'West Coast Whales'. [laughter] Because you're not gonna see them-
Mmm, whatcha got?
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.
[uses book to stop the sandwitch's flight] You're getting nut particles all in the air!
[steps into conference room] Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.
Michael, This is insane.
Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
[walks out] Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...?
Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. [extents hands for hug] Bring it in, come on. [Michael doesn't accept hug] Ok. [walks back]
I... I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you.
Ok. What is the Native American girl's name?
