Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
[fake coughing] Narc!
I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
Uuf, well...
[shakes head] Okay...
Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
Waa... what? What are you talking about?
Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
I can do that, it is my office.
Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.
It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'
I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Yes it is.
Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
Really? [Jim shakes his head no]
Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.
The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
Yes, I will not be.
Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Just forget it.  Just the urine.
Just. I need your urine.
Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
It's none of your business.
Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
I need clean urine for the lady.
Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Why?  Wha...
Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
Yes, sir.
So you wanna? Thanks.
Okay.
Good.
No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes]
Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.
Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.
Exactly. I know. It's amazing.
Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.
One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...
No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.
No? okay, fine.
Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]
Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?
Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.
Well...
I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?
Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
That's a nice tie.
That is... who makes that?
Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?
What's the problem?
So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Yes.
Yeah?
Okay.
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Okay... what?
Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
Come on, seriously, that?
Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
[claps his hands twice] It is done!
Yes.
Are those all the other complains?
I would like to see those please.
You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?
Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.
[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?
What?!
Stanley. [off camera]
[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.
Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Oh... ok.
Okay, well... all settled, then.
OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Uh. Dwight.
Okay! Calm down.
Hey, hey!
Stop.
Okay...
Dwight...
Stop...
Oh... kay...
Okay.
Yes.
Mm-hmm.
[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'
[reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'
[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'
By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'
The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
Good. Okay.
Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
It'll take like two seconds.
Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
Come on, everybody.
We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
What?
[off camera] You just press the button.
[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.
[off camera] That's terrible.
[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?
But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.
There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.
There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.
Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Top 80 percent!
Yeah?
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Oh, come on. Come on.
You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
What?
That's a dog.
That's a shawl.
No. Humans with AIDS.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
Why are you here?
Not. I said, not that.
That's ironic.
That you are afraid.
Dinkin' flicka.
Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
[phone rings] Yes
Who?
Do I know a Carol Stills?
Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
Hey, Jan. How you doing?
I am?
Oh, okay.
AIDS.
Okay, sounds great.
Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Right.
Yeah?
What?
Okay.
Problem. Good.
Good, All right. Sounds great.
Bye.
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Carol.
You look great.
Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]
Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Okay.
Billy, your nurse is hot.
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Chili's is great.
Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
All-in. [Other players fold their hands]
Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
What are... That's insane.
Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Okay, all right, whatever.
You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves]
Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jan.
Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
Um...
Hey. What...
All right!
Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!
Yeah!
So close. So close.
Hey, okay.
Thank you.
Okay. Thanks for coming.
Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Good night. She's a good boss.
Oh, she's great.
Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
No.
No.
I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]
How about a location?
Where the hell is that?
Okay, all right.
No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
We already have that. So...
No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.
Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company's doing fine.
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.
Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.
[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan.
Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
Crisis Management Squad.
Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
To save time, Jim.
You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
Midnight, Oscar!
Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
I want you to bring a partner.
No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J.
I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
Here
OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.
And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
So, let us consider this matter ended.
I know, I know you're angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
Well, we are extremely sorry.
We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
The watermark... it's a one time thing.
OK...
What... can I do, for you?
Well... [exhales] OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
I'm
No, I'm a regional manager---
No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
Doesn't matter.  Out please!
Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?
We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
You're right.  It will blow over.  But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?
[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.
Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.'
That's how devoted I am to this job.
I know.
I understand that, Dwight.
Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
So I'll know where---
I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
OK, ready?
Five, four, three.  'There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn't be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me.  They're trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.'
That's... they always give an ultimatum.
Good, cut?
Thought so too.
The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.
With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.
So we're good?
I'm sorry.
Okay.
All right. We are infinitely sorry.
You understand? You... you get this check.
The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.
Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.
And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.
Are we ready?
Okay. Am I shiny?
Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.
[clears throat] Stop it.
I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.
What's happening?
Really? Is she OK?
OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]
Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
[laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]
Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.
Huh?
I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
I... uh, well, I don't know.
[exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
OK.
This is the last
Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
That is not current.
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Yes.
Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Ye - OK, yes.
You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]
OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!
[Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]
Many women
All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.
What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
Yeah, that's smart.
That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do?
OK, it stopped.
Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]
Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
OK, I am really going to do this.
You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]
I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.
[leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Thank you.
Abso-fruit-ly.
No... No...
Yeah.
Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
[sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
Love it.
Uh, yes, I am.
Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.
The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
We should really start recycling.
Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
I got shotgun.  Damn it.
Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!
Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.
Idiot.
I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]
Maybe.
Not it. I don't have eggs.
That's possible.
Uh-huh?
The CFO? Ohh...
OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?
Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
...you just gots to get your freak on.
Yeah.
Hmmm.
Really?
Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
May God guide you in your quest.
OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.
Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
This way to the partay bus.
Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!
Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
I'm not playing.
Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
Then I will name your team the Red team.
I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]
[off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?
Thanks a bunch.
A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
I can't say.
The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
[points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.
Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
13 hot dogs, everybody!
It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go.
Aaaaaand, go!
Nice, Stanley!
One. Two. Three.
Excellent!
I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Please just check.
What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Pointless.
Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
Ji.. why not? C'mon.
You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.
Yes. Count to three, please.
Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Okay.
Don't, don't.
I'm not going to give it to you.
Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
God! He's a comedian.
Who's Amanda Bynes?
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
You are being too modest.
Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
That is a very, very funny story.
Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?
Acrimonious.
This way to the party bus. Good.
It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]
Nothing.
No.
No!
No.
No, we are not.
You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...
...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
Any questions?
Yup.
Yes, for dramatic affect.
Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
Set!
Go!
[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
Because he wasn't following the rules.
But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
Okay, all right.
It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...
Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?
Who's got the hungry?
Come on, Ryan...
Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
[Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!
You? You haven't made a sale.
Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.
Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
This is an inflatable sumo suit. [blows] Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed. [blows] And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It's about who is the best boss.  And I don't even care who wins. [blows] It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit... [breathes in] that will tell me all I need to know [blows] or how sumo... [collapses]
Are we all set?
Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
Thought I'd catch a show.
Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
Um, how many people are you interviewing?
Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
Ah, great. No further questions.
Okay.
And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
[knock on door] Yeah.
Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Okay. Uh...
Uh, okay.
Stop crying.
Ohhhhh...
Why so you can do it?
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Moon each other.
All right.
Your loss.
Cruise control.
There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Yes, I...
I have to buy another place.
I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
Who is D. Abramson?
Why... are you here?
I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Why privately?
Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Okay.
Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
No. She's an alternate.
So, how you been?
Good.
Yeah.
Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
Hmm.
Sound good. Sounds fun.
Hmm..
Would you excuse me for a second?
Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
No, no. What do I do?
What if she makes me?
She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
I wasn't.
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Wow.
I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Yeah.
First got priorities.
Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
No.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you this, it is
[holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.
Wait, wait. Check one more time.
Very good [Jan nods]
Yes, indeed.
So, I guess we're getting back together.
Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
[exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
That
Mm-hmm.
No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Jan in yet?
Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means.
Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?
[knocks on door] Hello, hello!
Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
Thank you.
I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.
Okay.
Thank you.
It is always a treat when
Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
Hey.
Pretty good.
Could have gone better I guess.
Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
I can't tell you.
Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Hey!
No--- We're all unstable.
David, I did not tell her.
So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.
I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
[in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
That's stupid.
You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.
No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.
So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!
New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.
Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.
Yes I was. Yes I was.
That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
What shape?
Alright.
After breakfast.
So how you feeling about the new company?
You excited? About the new company?
After breakfast.
No, I'm whipping them.
Just let go.
Let go, please. Just gimmee -
I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
Don't patronize me, Pam.
I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
It's totally impossible!
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Okay, Ryan.
He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
He worked at that telemarketing place.
Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Yeah.
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...
Alright.
Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Okay. Okay. 'Achey Breaky Fart.'
No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs.
We can do this.
Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.
Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.
Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
I'm...
Excuse me. Yes?
Yes, it is.
Yes.
It is.
Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Uh, nine.
[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.
He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
He's already paying for himself.
Right here.
Oh yeah.
Sounds awesome.
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
By wanting it more. By working hard-
Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
And I offer same day, free delivery.
Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
What's that?
Blech.
Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]
You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
[walks into room] Okay.
It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
Yeah, I'm good. You good?
You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']
Yes, I am, Charles.
Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Would someone just make the copy?
Just make that copy okay?
They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
That's my corner.
No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.
What for?
Yes.
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Hey Pam.
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Yeah?
Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
These are shaped like paper.
I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
They don't know that!
Give him a guarantee.
Just say the word.
Yes!
You did!
Oh yeah!
She did it!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]
Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.
Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]
Hey.
[gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?
Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
I really appreciate it.
It's for your trouble.
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Yes, I do.
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]
[on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
I'm not following you.
Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!']
[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight?
Is the cool new guy Charles?
Is it Stanley?
Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Dwight, run!
You be cool.
Just-what's going on?
Mm-do... Dwight would not-
I. Understand. Nothing.
[Michael storms into office] Wow.
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
Hello, traitor.
I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
I'm just getting hardcore with him.
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
[on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?
[on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Wow. High score?
Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Toward the sun.
Noon.
You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
Dwight.
I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
I do too.
Cooper's.
Damn it.
[Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
What?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
[Michael answers phone] Yeah.
Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying 'Dwight did it!!'] You?
What about our truce?
On purpose?
Why?
Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!
Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Walking in the door...
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
That's very rude.
I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Good, good, good. I will see you.
I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'
I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.
[honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!
Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.
Milk and sugar.
That's what I said.
Every morning.
We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
Most do in the magazines.
We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
They are correct, sir.
Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
Lowest in town.
Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
Explain that.
Well, we don't--
Whatever, yeah.
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.
Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.
I would love that.
Was it nice?
I love Pad Thai.
No.  There's a lot I haven't done.
[knocking on door] Hmm?
We're not hiring, Jim.
Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
No-- We don't have--
[stammers] Uh... Yes.
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
That's a pun.
Yep. Oh... wow.
Of course not.
Nope, nope, nope.
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
Ah...
I'm good, I'm good.
It is.  I'm good.
Hello.
Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables...
And we are prepared to reject that offer.
Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
[stutters] We'll have to talk--
Just amongst ourselves.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
We are so rich.
No.
It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
Agreed?
Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
And I want Charles gone.
I need him gone.
Okay, then I want Pam back.
Sales.
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
And Ryan.
You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
And dental this time.
These are our demands.
Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
Can we have the room please?
Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!
There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
No, no. You're done.
Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
[whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
Yes.
Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
Oscar, what were you going to say?
All right.
Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
No, you lost those clients.
Okay.
Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.
[hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
Pamela.
Yep.
I know.
I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Okay, well---
I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Against who?
The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
That was  us, right there.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, the Commish.
Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
Hey gang. Where you been?
Where'd you eat?
What'd you have, Stanley?
So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
Who quits?
You guys gotta be kidding.
I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  [throws money at Phyllis] There you go.  There's some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
Yes I do.
It's frontward's.
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Whatever you guys did earlier.
Just do it, okay?
Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.
Are you kidding me?
Okay, okay, okay.
So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology.
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
You're close with Pam too.
Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
I like his hair.
Okay.
That sounds pretty biased.
Okay. Pam, pros.
I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
I don't need to tell you that.
I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
Oh, wow!  Whoa!
Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
I'm sorry, sorry.
[laughing] Yes, you did.
Yep.
No, you--no.
No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
[laughing] Oh, oh!
You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Oh, really?
Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Could you send her in?
Hello.
Have a seat.
This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
Oh, your face!  Oh!
No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Oh...
I don't know, actually.
[caught by camera crew dancing to 'At the Car Wash', but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Oh, really? Ok.
What about the rest of you? [complete silence]
At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
What?
Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
[still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
That's good.
If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Now you got it.
Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Ok. I love it. I love it.
I love it.
Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.
Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Andy's afwaid?
Are you all afwaid?
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Funk is the problem and the solution.
I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Exactly.
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Holdin' down the fort.
Thank you.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Kevin, stay.
Kevin, stay.
Stay, stay.
Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on.
Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.
Phyllis?
Hey!
[starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Oh, wow! What did you do?
You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
No. No. No.
It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
[barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.
You having fun?
What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
It's better than I imagined it!
Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Oh. Alright. There you go.
No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.' [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.
Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
No... cleaning... up.
Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Really?
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.
Would you like to dance?
My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.
[mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
[wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny?
Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
See you later!
We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Okay.
You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
What is up with you two, Holly?
Cool. For who?
Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
You bet your fat ass we are.
Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
That's right.
Newspapers for sale!
I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
[watching her eat] What?
Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Oh!
Could we get a Delorean?
Oh! [to the theme of 'Jaws'] Dun-der. Dun-der...
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh]
No. No.
We're circling it.
[shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it's a sketch now.
And now, presenting...
[imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]
Yes, I am.
Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
[screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
Yes!
I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
David Wallace told me!!
[whispers] I guess not.
Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
Thank you.
Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
Should've had hindsight.
I think it went well. I think it was good.
No, it was a tough audience.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Good to see you. [they hug] AJ.
I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
I'm going to give Erin $15.
A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
She's kind of a rube.
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to...[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.
Ugh.
Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
Okay, well, we'll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]
[looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
All right.
[in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
[shakes head, annoyed] I don't know.
Ahhh.
Right. [sighs]
An age or month?
I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
So how are things going with Andy?
Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
I don't think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
Okay.
I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?
Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
Thank you.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Well...
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!
[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
No. No. No.
Stop talking.
Oh God.
Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
Erin?
No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
You said butt.
Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'
[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.
No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Buenos dias, Jaime.
Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
La telefona.
[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.
Yo soy Cancun.
Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Hi. How are you?
There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
[barges in] Hi.
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
Okay, I have more of them.
I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.
It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
Ryan.
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.
Hmm.
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
I think we could. [Donna giggles]
Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
Why don't you run them again?
If she is, it's working.
So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
They're good [Donna grabs mint]
Sure.
I can't stop myself from kissing her.
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
Okay. What do you think?
Andy?
Okay, some for, some against.
Pam?
I'm going with Pam's group.
Here we go.
Okay.
No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Okay.
Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
I don't know. I think so.
[whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
Thank you so much.
Mmm. [Donna giggles]
[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
All right. All right. Bye.
And have a good elevator ride.
Oh, what's that out there?
I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
She suckered you too.
Was it the cleavage?
Yep.
God. She left this here?
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
[hold up barrette] Well...
Yeah, I know. I know.
I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]
[runs down to parking lot, sighs]
Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
Who?
About what?
No, no. No.
No... [they kiss again]
[returns to office] What happened?
Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
Okay.
Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
Oh!
That's fun.
All right.
We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
... and... we had sex, too.
How?
How do I not make any more of it?
All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'
Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Yeah, she does all that.
No, no...
Run what?
Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
That's what makes it so wrong.
Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
This is you. How much do you charge?
I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
Okay.
It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.
I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
God, this is so disgusting.
I know.
That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
Helene?
Oh.
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]
You're back. What happened?
No, what happened with Donna?
Ugh!
No. No! Are you sure?
Who eats eight protein bars?
Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
What? No, she didn't say that.
I am not paying for that membership.
[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...
No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
That's her?
Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.
I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]
...poop my pants.
Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
We are?
Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.
Hey.
Well it can wait. It can wait.
Jim is her husband.
And they are having problems, so sh...
Good in bed.
Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
Okay, weirdo.
Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
I have to hear it from her.
I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
I need to have her say...
I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'
No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.
You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
Wouldn't that be fun?
How about Thursday?
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
Nope, that's Tuesday.
You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]
Who is he?
The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
I'm the mistress?
Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]
Pfffffttt.
You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
Okay, alright.
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
I don't know.
Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
[shouting] Toby, just do it! God!
Good work. [clapping]
[walks in] Morning everyone.
Hello!
Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]
Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
No, I gotta go. Text me later.
Hey.
Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
That... exists?
Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
I am Beyonce always.
Yes, I am.
I would love that.
I have work to do.
Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
All right, Andy, please.
Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
Right there. The coach!
Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
You have no idea what you're talking about.
You don't. No, no.
You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'
Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
[whispers] Okay.
No. God. You go talk to him.
No, no, no.
I'm good. Oh, my God.
Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
You love it. There ya go.
Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
I did.
No. We just talked. He's very nice.
It did not.
Isn't it?
I'm awful, aren't I?
I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
Yeah, I noticed that.
Nope.
I have got big balls.
Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes]
[driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
Yes?
[sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.
Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
Yes.
Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
Please.
Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.
Jo! We were not expecting you!
Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
Okay.
We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
Okay.
Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
Is there something that you would like to say to me?
About talking to the press?
Mmhmm.
I don't believe you.
That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
Oh, no, no, no...
Oh my god. Was she cute?
Oh, god, Darryl!
I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.
You leaked it?
I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
Oh.
Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
What do we got?
It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
Just don't say no.
That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
Okay. You can count on me.
Hey Jo.
I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
What?
It doesn't matter what I know.
Why?
Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]
What?
Are you going to kill me?
[on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
I have rights.
I am not going to tell you anything.
Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
Hmm, hmm.
You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
[to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
That was fun.
Thanks. Today helped.
Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
[arriving at the first house] Alright let's go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]
Surprise!
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
[holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down.
[next house] Congratulations!
We got it.
Yeah that's fine.
[next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house]
[giggles] Go go go go go go!
[arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I've never seen this place in the daylight.
Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
[quietly shuts the door] Go.
[walking into the office] Good morning Erin.
You have big plans for tonight?
You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.
The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Black tie optional.
A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]
Think of it as part of your training.
[smiling] Okay, well we'll work on it.
You are doing it.
[all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?
[very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly]
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
Jim, please no loopholes.
This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
Good. Good. Good!
Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
[getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let's try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- [DeAngelo winces] That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.
Say it with an accent!
[also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!
I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
[in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
[slaps him] You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there.
Say it.
You can do it, just say it.
Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.
Alright, here we go.
Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]
There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]
Well done.
Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight...
Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.
You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage]
[escorts Erin off stage] There you go.
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
[stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
Okay, we're done! That's it.
We're done. We're done!
[Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
What?
No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
That got a big laugh.
[to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?
We're really close.
That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
[in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
What is your problem?!
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
He is in an all-out sprint.
[in conference room] Here... [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]
Oh, okay. [nods to him]
Oh my God, something's happening.
[choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].
No it's not.
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]
Yes?
Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
[Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
...in order to feed the bears.
How do you mean?
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Okay.
Hm?
Well I have interviews.
Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
Oh you don't, that's-
That sounds good. Thank you.
Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
[walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Mmm!
You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
What do you like Pam?
What kind of toppings would you like?
Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]
[holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
[pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.
Ahh.
[hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
You're not gonna lose them.
Just do your best! I have faith in you.
Kevin, I have something for you.
You know who that is?
[rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
You will find love.
Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
[quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]
[laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
Mmhmm, bravo!
Sure!
Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
I guess this could be the one, huh?
My last pay check?
No.
I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
Nah, I'm almost done.
Yeah.
[crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone]
Hi. What is the name of our town?
No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
[laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
[laughing] Ohh, I miss you.
Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
[hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
[grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.
[walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
[in Ryan's office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
Yeah.
You're not prone to seizures?
[sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
[disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused]
[walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!
I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
No problem. Worth a try.
[in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
[picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]
[still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]
Kevin?
Ahhhh...
Maybe neither.
Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
N-
Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
[in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
You should see the other guy.
[looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?
But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
[in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
[Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.
No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
What is this meeting about?
Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
[cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Umm, hmm?
[the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!
[sad] Ohh...
[holding back tears] Okay...
Maybe.
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
Oh, okay.
[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Alright.
I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.
No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
Later guys. [leaves the office]
Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
That's what she said.
[crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.
