Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Nope. The opposite of that.
Ok, good.
I probably will, why do you ask?
Yeah.
What
This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
Alright.
Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]
Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.
Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
So what's going on? What I miss?
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
Yeah, yeah.
Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?
What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]
[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.
[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
Questions?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]
Oh, ok. Alright.
No you're not.
Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]
I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]
I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]
Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]
Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.
I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.
I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.
This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.
Great. Thank you.
Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.
You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
Hey, Dwight.
You all right Ryan?
Pam!
That's what she said!
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
Insult.
[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.
Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
I do. Both of them.
No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
[generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.
You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
Yeah.
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
Well, it's mostly made up. So...
Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
Confidence, Dwight.
It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
Dwight, they called your name.
All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!
Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?
Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
I got thirsty. How'd it go?
You would not believe what happened here.
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
That's it? You're going to end with 'etcetera'? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...
That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
It's your delivery...
Our biggest worry.
My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting]
See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.
No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.
Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.
Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead.
Anything your heart desires.
[shouting] Louder!
Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.
Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.
Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...
Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.
Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.
Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
You're weird.
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? 'Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?' 'Jell-O pudding.' Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car. [imitating race car engine] That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List. [baby crying] Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.
Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
... Oh, God is that today?
Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still.
Well, I'll be in my office.
They're cool.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
[under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.
Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
Oh.
Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?
Okay.
[on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
[on phone] Yes. Well... we can... [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael's toy train] uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael's desk] Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?
Nice to meet you.
Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?
All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]
Dwight! Dwight!
What the hell are you reading to them?
Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
What's a Nazi?
Don't!
Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
[sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay?
Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]
This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
I'm not just a middle... man...
You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
Say hi to the kids.
Yaaaaay.
What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
It's true. I did.
I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Oka--
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
[to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
Yeah.
Uhh, I don't know.
Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
Coulda sworn there was...
...uh, no.
Uh, just never happened.
Uh, nope.
I do okay.
Yes.
Okay! Alright, okay.
...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
[Toby knocks on door] Yeah?
Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
Thank you.
You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
What about...
...Jan. Kay.
...Or biologically.
Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
Oh... kay.
Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
[singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
One more time. [singing] You...
Hey, don't touch him, please!
Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Sure.
Okay. There you go.
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.
Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call.
Oh ho ho! What?
Thank you! That's really nice.
Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
What's up?
Ah, thank you sir.
[Dwight knocks on door] Yeah.
Ohh, god.
No no no, no, new suit, please.
Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
Good luck. One of a kind.
Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in]
[answering phone] Yeah?
Oh, great, put her through.
Hey, you.
It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Thanks. [grins]
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up]
[to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.
Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
Thanks.
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
You didn't know it was my birthday.
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].
Mmm.
Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
[laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous.
When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
[eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?
Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].
What?
[grinning] Ohhh, God.
Ohhh, no.
Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
Okay.
Thank you.
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
Get in here... everybody.
Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
The best.
Yes.
Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...
Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles]
... I asked for trick candles.
Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
And laughter... also.
Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
How dare you sir. You are gross.
[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Okay. Well. Live strong.
Alright.
Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
Oh, these... all your kids?
Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.
Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].
Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
Yeah.
Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]
Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.'
Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
Good. Great.
No, I think you're gonna stay.
On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.
[knock on door] Mmm-hmm.
Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.
Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.
Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'
Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
Huh?
Pop quiz.
Why is today a special day?
Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
In business school, Kevin. Business school.
A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
Will they throw their hats, you think?
A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line.
I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!
We have fun.
Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!
Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?
Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
...And products!
Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]
...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
...Wait, Ryan said that?
Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
David will always beat Goliath.
Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!
Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
You heard me, pack your things.
Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
Wow! You did these... freehand?
My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?
I don't see a... price.
Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
What?
...Chunky. Do you want half?
Okay.
It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.
Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
So no?
Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.
No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
Don't do what I say, say what I do.
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up.
That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.
I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.
Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.
No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.
OK.
Very good.
OK.
Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.
How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.
And now, the chains.
A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]
AHHHH!
Yes.
I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
Alright.
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Pam, would you smell my breath?
Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
Sure? Might be a good idea.
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Play some games?
I spy?
Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you.
Hey, Buttercup.
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
That's what she said.
Uh, yes you are.
No problem. [doesn't turn off speakerphone]
Ok.
Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
Ummm... I don't know.
Maybe.
Ok.
Alright. Bye.
Beauty. Thank you sir!
Thank you.
Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Yes.
Ok.
Hi.
Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
Oh, um, potato salad.
No, it's not.
Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
What are you looking for? You bring dip?
Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
Over our love.
You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
It's a heart.
I love this woman!
Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Ok.
It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
I could go for an appeteaser.
Bagel bites or something.
Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
David, how much did this house cost?
Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]
Yeah. Do you have any ice?
How about some Splenda?
This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
Crazy.
Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
What are you doing?
Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
What has gotten into you?
No, no, no.
Come on, let's go back to the party.
Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
Whatever.
That's all, you didn't mean it?
I love you, Jan.
What a weird day.  I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they're the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.
No need for consternation, everything is under control.
It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
No...
No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
Yeppers.
I don't... remember.
Yeesh...
Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
Wikipedia.
Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish]
What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]
Ok, see what I did?
By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
Ok, let's try another one.  Um...
Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
It's a surprise.
Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
[gets up and begins to walk out of the room]
What?
No, what did you say?
Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
[knock on door] Yeah.
Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.
No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off.
Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
[long pause] I am declining to speak first.
Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
What?
No, this is a power suit.
[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
Ohh... kay.
All right.
Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit.  At the very least it's bisexual.
Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
Okay.
Would you stop it, please?
It's European, OK?  It's a European cut.
No, they don't.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]
Italians don't wear pockets.
No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.
Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
[mumbles jibberish]
[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.
[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.
I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.
Oh. [scoffs] Come on.  Be serious.
I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
Plus perks, yes.
Fourteen years.
No, please, please...
Ok, let's take 15, again.
A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
Oh, thank you.
I didn't give you $40.
Okay.  Okay, here's the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
Well what am I supposed to do?
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
[exhales] That's true.
You know what?  I should.
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
You know what?  I deserve a bump.
I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I'll leave right away.
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
Mm-hm.
Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
[talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
[sighs] Fine.
Toby, come on.  Let's go.
Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go.
Yeah.  Fine.
[imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
Well...
Mm, the Big Apple.
Maybe I'll stay.
Well...
[mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I...
Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
All right.
Who's the boy toy?
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Pippity poppity.
Six percent?  After all we've been through?
I got you... jade earrings.
No!
No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?
Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere.
Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
But you just said 15.
Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  It's about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--
Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.
Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
Hmm.
I can, and I have.
Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.
I thought your name was Pudge?
Okay.  Um, her.
Ah, fine.
Yeeesh.
[barely keeping his composure] 'Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!' [laughs]
Bail'er?  I hardly know her.
Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
It's a big red trash compactor!
Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
...would I go near---
Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'
Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Yes.  Okay, let's do another one.  This is a good one.  'A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---'
Yes.  'Which can contribute to heart disease.'  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
No.
Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men's Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I'd like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make 'em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  'Hello, I'm Michael.  Welcome to Men's Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example.
Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
Indubitably.
They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
I don't know, I don't know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
Nn--- Depression.
Yes.
You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods]
Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
Go buy some watermelons.
Just...
Let's do it!  Drop that sucker.
BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
Yes, thank you for seeing that.
I don't know if I wanna do this.
No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
Rock n' roll!
That's right!  I am not thinking.
Yes!  Yeah!
Woo!
Woo!
I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]
[on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life...
Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Okay... that's...
That's the whole point, dummy.
Okay.
Oooooh, my life!
Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
Dwight, you ignorant slut.
And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Damn it.
What is it?
Dwight, find out what the present is.
Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
What do I have to live for?
It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
Do you really mean that?
I'm braver than you?
I Braveheart.  I am.
Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That's the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can't say.  But, yes.
OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let's go.
Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.
Here we go.
Field Trip.
Like we're going to the science museum.
Learn by touching.
I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.
Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...
I...
Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.
We got beat today, Dwight.
But it was not a fair fight.
It was the warehouse guys...
... Dwight, they embarrassed us...
... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.
How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery
Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks]
Yeah, Drew.
You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.
I will miss you the most Ryan.
Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.
[coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
...Jim.
Ayyyy!
Ayyyy!
[laughing] What was that?
That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting...
Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]
Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
Pam, really, they're back?
Can I have a word with you, Jim?
Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Mm-hmm.
Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
--that none of us can be a part of--
[gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --
Okay.  Hello.
Oh, OK.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, well, that's fine.
Yeah, can I point something out to you?
You're actually talking a lot.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat]
Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.
Type O-Ocean Spray.
Yick.
I looked at the bag.
I looked straight at the bag.
Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?
That was mean.
A hat.
That is full of soup.
What?
Oh, already.
Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]
[ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]
Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.
Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?
Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
Really sad.
Oh my God.
Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?
What?
You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
No.  Not a giant net.
I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
Old fashioned meet market --
-- I don't think it is.
These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
Hey.
Ah, still early.
[sighs] So how you holding up?
No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Meh, exactly.  Eh.
Oh, here we go.
Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]
Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?
Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.
No reason.
Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Hey, you don't deserve her.
Hey, if anybody wants to go...
Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks.
You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
[after some encouragement] OK.
Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
Pam?
Pam? Knock, knock.
I know you are. Knock, knock.
[at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]
Buddha.
[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]
I, I need something to wipe my hand.
That was helping. It was classic.
No... God.
Alright.
Who's there?
KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face]
What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight]
What are you doing?
You, you like that?
Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
[to Jim] Who's there?
Dwight, get the door.
Answer the door.
I'm not gonna answer it
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
Woo hoo.
Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
Invite them on the tour.
Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
Yeah?
Yeah.
I thought I did. So...
Well no harm no foul.
You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
Irrelevant.
OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs]
Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?
No, they can't.
Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
Thank you, Jim is with me.
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.
OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
That is not constructive.
[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
How are you doing?
[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
You're breaking up.
OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
Yes.
No.
[long pause] Yes.
[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
Woah, wow, who told you that?
[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Why do you have a diary?
OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
Yes, you did.
What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary]
Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
Umm, nacho chips.
Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
[sighs] It's not ready yet.
I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
Right.
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
You kind of have.
Yes.
[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
Give me the details of how that happened.
What?
David? David?
David?
Could I be a part of the meeting also?
There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
Oh how dare you.
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
Oh please.
Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
Thank You!
Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
I want to see it.
I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary]
Give me...  Give me the diary.
I like it.
I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
And classy, yeah.
[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
Yes.
He is.
That's what makes him classy.
Strawberries?
Not classy at all.
French. Classy.
[on speakerphone] Yes?
Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is.
Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
Yes.
What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.
Took me all night.
I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
Oh, nerd alert!
This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy]
There you go! Where's the other?
Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps]
Oh! Well...
Above and beyond.
That's true.
No. Absolutely not.
Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
Well, why don't-
Charles is going to tell you.
Well, it's not official.
Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
Well-
Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
[on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
It was my understanding.
Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
But the branch is still mine?
Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]
I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
You're not from paper?
Does David know this?
Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
Whatever David wants.
[on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.  [redials]
Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
And I really really need to talk to David.
I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief]
Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
Nobody thanked me.
For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
[on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
Yep.
Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Yes it is!
No, it is not.
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
No, seriously.
How old are you?
Five years old?
I'm gonna walk away.
I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
What is that smaller stripper holding?
Ok.
Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
But it's cool, and it's-
Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Yeah, why don't you do that?
Yeah, here we go. Ok.
What?
Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves]
Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office]
[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
I drove.
Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
Clearly that's what you wanted.
Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
I've put having a family on hold.
And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.
Ok.
[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.
You have no idea how high I can fly.
Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.'
Why would I do that?
You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
[slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.
I have a job.
Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
Any good headhunter knows I am available.
You're 'I need you to' is my command.
Hey.
You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
Oh! Hey. What is this about?
Oh.
Me too, me too. Is this wine?
I already have wine.
Hmm?
For?
Yes I am.
Where you from?
That's a drive!
[sighs]
Thank you. [groaning ceases]
You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone]
[sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh... [chuckles].
PSST! PSST!
Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
yeah!
Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
Close them.
Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
Obviously.
Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
No I'm staying.
Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I'm on it, don't worry.  So, how do I do that?
Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Thank you very much.
I'm starting my own paper company.
Yeah.
Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
Potential, lots of potential. yes.
It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
I made it sterile.
I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
No, no no.
Okay.
Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me.
[from inside the restroom] Stanley?
Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
Hmm?
Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...
Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
[to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to...
[yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!
... and I feel free!
Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.
No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
So which way are you leaning?
Thanks Jim.
Okay, Okay, we don't have much time.  Just act normal.  Don't look at me people. Stop.  Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me.  Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  You're older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?  [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot.  Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me.  Come on Phyllis.  Here we go, here we go!
Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
I think maybe Hank should be here.
You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.
You are?
Okay.  It's going to be great.
Right... Executive assistant.
Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
Well, okay, lets go.
Are people watching?
Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.
Bye.
Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!
Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]
The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
I will allow that.
Okay.
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
Yes, Phyl?
[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.
Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
Okay, the opposite of that?
Ooh, someone's freakin'.
I think he is.
Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it's time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
We can do...
Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
What is October feast?
Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
That's right, let's do this.
Let's go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
Are you kidding?
You can do this.  You can do this.
I'm scared, too.
Yeah.
We're going to have a baby.
Let's do that.
Two minutes apart.
It's okay.
I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
You're not going to.  You know where you're going?
Yes, you are.  And you know what you're going to have?
Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
Yes.
Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?
You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
Thank you!  Wish me luck!
[entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We're going now!
No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
Dwight, what is the traffic like?
Alright.
Geesh, Dwight!
What!?
Where?
By the bushes?
Okay, go, go, go, go!
Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
Yeah?
I'm texting about you, okay!?
Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?
Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
Okay.
Okay.
Do you have everything, guys?
Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]
Dunder-Mifflin.  It's okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.
Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I'm going to go wash my eyes.
That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
I think it's going to be any minute now.
Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?
Okay.  You can't smoke anywhere these days.
Guys, guys!
Eleven pounds...
Thank you!  Thank you!
Where's the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
Love you, as a friend.
Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
Alright.
Oh, okay.
Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
Who else here is single?
I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.
Andrew, what about you?
Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth.  Why don't you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
Good!
Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
Bye.
Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
I'm not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
No.
Lynn was as hot as Erin.
This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Kev...  Nice.  Going.
[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think I'm going to be sick...
It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
Morning, honey-pile.
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
Yes it is!
No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
Mm, that sounds great, actually.
When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
That is a great idea JB.
Oscar, homosexual accountant.
Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
Okay.
Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
Well, I am heading down there.
How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]
I did!
You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.
No is not an option.
All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
[laughs] I'll be over there.
Very nice.
A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
Okay. All right.
Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
Right. What?
Mm. mm. Oh well.
No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
Hey Pack-man.
How you doing stud? You already there?
How's the lady situation?
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
Yeah. Maybe next year.
How late do we have to work tonight?
Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
Hello Jo.
There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
Yes.
Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
Drinks are on me!
Oh -hoh! All right.
Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, 'Don't worry, be happy.'
Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?
Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
[laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
In my condo complex.
I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
I know, I know.
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.
No sales topic per se.
Dwight?
I would like your undivided attention, please.
Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
Yeah.
M-hmm.
Is that all you have to say to me?
Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]
Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
You writing your memoirs over there?
Well, it's a pretty big check.
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
I'm just saying, that -
Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's -
You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
The sales department smashed my sandwich.
You don't get it.
That's what she said.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Ah, just the stupid leads.
Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]
Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
They act like I have no power.
Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
Exactly that.
Exactly that.
Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! [hands him a lead]
- and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead]
And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar's shoulder].
I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
Hey.
Mm-hmm.
Okay. [passes Jim some index cards]
Alright.
Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
I do understand it.
Or is it?
Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads: 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business.
Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
Wait. What day is today?
Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!
Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -
Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.'
Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
Really?
Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!
You can.
Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.
Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
Assistant to the managed him -
Yeah.
You think you would have done better without me? Really?
Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
That's my wife you're talking about, man.
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!
Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]
Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.
We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]
This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?
Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?
Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:
In the dump.
No! Better!
How many is that?
Count the last one.
Oh, new record!
Oh, what did you do today?
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!
What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
[Stanley straining and breathing heavily] Oh, wow, that is adorable!
Yeah, I'm betting one more.
Good.
Alright, alright. [chanting continues]
Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.
Yes?
Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
Ok, yes. Sure.
No, I got that.
I am in.
It's a deal.
Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]
It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
Sucks to be you.
That would be sublime.
Yes.
Hello, how are you?
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
So, what do you do?
Really?
See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
About what?
She's nice.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah, sure.
About what?
[removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]
Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]
Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
[choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
Hello.
Hi.
Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.
Really? You told on me. That's lame.
Yes. Homelessness. What?
Where?
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
She can't talk to us that way.
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Well, I am starting it again!
Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
I've written all of it... in my head.
If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
I own a Chrysler.
No, you shut up.
Grenadine.
I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
No, no.
No, it's Michael Scott.
He is I.
Oh, hey guys. [thumbs up]
Hey, Julie! You having fun? [Julie leaves]
Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
Erin... what are you doing?
That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
It's got a lot of me.
Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]
Dwight does not play a robot.
By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
That was not scripted.
[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]
[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
Hey.
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
Did you? What did you love about it?
No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.
Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval]
We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]
Hey...
No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
[laughs at the stupidity]
Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!
No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]
Still not seeing the problem here.
It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss]
Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Whoa!
Is Packer here?
[peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.
[sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]
[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.
Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
No!
Best day ever. Best day ever!
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Please.
Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.
No. Not me, him.
Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
He's funnier than me.
So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
[seems taken aback] Uhm...
That's insane!
And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]
I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Yeah.
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
No it isn't.
Yeah, a little bit.
I won't.
[Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Kevin, do you accept the apology?
Okay, go back to the annex.
That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
What are you doing?
I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Yes, about that.
Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
No, nothing like that at all.
Sorry?
[thinks a moment] Sounds great.
That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
Nah, he's an ass.
[imitating] You ahh.
No you ahh.
[kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.
I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
500
Get lost.
That is how you do it.
You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
In case... in case of what?
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Get lost.
[on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
Hi.
Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
Well, I'm writing a message.
I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
Maybe.
Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
Pam.
I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
No, this is romantic.
Why?
I did?
Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
Yes.
I could not have agreed with you more.
Yes. Thank you.
No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
Heres the ring.
Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
Is she not going to like that?
At a gas station?
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
I just... it's terrifying.
I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Oh ok. For how long?
Is he alright?
You ok?
Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
Ok.
No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
Hey, how'd we do?
That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
This is where we first kissed.
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
In-grown hair.
Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
And over here..
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
Let's go in here.
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
That marriage would be a sham.
Easy no.
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
[the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
Yep.
Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Oh, really?
And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
That's what I've heard.
Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
Really? What happened?
Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]
No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.
You are? What bar?
I... do not see you.
I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
What're you wearing?
Are we both at the right place?
I hear your voice.
I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.
Wow... that is insane! [laughter]
[entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?
Alright! Here we go!
This is it. What do you think?
[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]
Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
Come on out!
I am well, sir, how are you?
And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Yes it was.
Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
You know me very well, Dwight.
Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
I sorta like the old way.
I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
Is that good?
Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
[to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck]
It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
That's-
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
Don't shave my lips.
You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
[interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]
I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth]
What?
Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.
No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?
No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
You'll figure it out.
