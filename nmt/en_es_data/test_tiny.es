Michael, stop doing that. I said stop that, right now.
Corporate wants to talk to you.
I put it right in there. Really hard.
Get off that right now!
What do you mean there's no Flangoose?
Don't you ever... and I mean ever... speak to me again.
Oh my God!
Please, Michael, for the love of God, get off there.
Fire! There's a fire!
