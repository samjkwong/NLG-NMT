Yeah, let's do it that way.
...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
Well, you have...
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Well, your office is behind you.
[smiles knowingly]
That is so good, Michael
Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
No you can't do that.
No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
So, I was looking so hot...
You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Thank you, Michael.
I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Where did you get these facts?
They are not.
No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
You can't do that.
That's not random.
I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Uh, hmmm.
Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
No, you will be tested.
You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
I'm all better.
What kind of filing?
That goes directly to the tester.
Like in a cup?
For what purpose?
Then I refuse.
Are you serious?
But that's illegal.
Not my urine.
Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
I'd still like one.
That's great.
It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Ten minutes.
Really?
That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.
I don't think so.
[salutes] Thank you, Michael.
I need to go over some details with you.
Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
How?
I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
Excuse me?
It's not me, either.
[on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
Has she been on the phone the whole time?
Nice.
The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
just drink a lot of water.
You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Thank you.
Um, I don't...
It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Since Christmas.
Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
These things just have a way of working themselves out.
It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
Okay.
That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
What's the next one?
Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
Win!
That's... no...
How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
But, it...
You solved it?
Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
Mmm-Hm.
I... I can't do that.
That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
[shoots twice]
Nice.
Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
You already did me.
Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Wait, what did it say?
I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
Dwight tried to kiss me.
Sure.
[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
We sit close.
I guess so...
[whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Him or me?
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Either he goes, or I go.
You choose!
One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
I am not bluffing!
Okay?
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
I deserve this. You know I do!
Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
I want an answer by tomorrow.
Fine.
Good. Okay.
I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
You mean digital?
20 bucks.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.
Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three...  whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]
That'll be another 20.
Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
You know, it was one day.
Oh, dear.
[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?
Oh, thanks.
[exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
I know.
He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
Let me see your ID.
There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.
You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Oh, my God.
[on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Michael?
You know that I'm very serious here.
What?
I thought that you were their fearless leader.
[laughs] I think you can handle it.
I think so, Michael...
Goodbye, Michael.
Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
Again? We do that every year.
It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Yes!
That doesn't exist anymore.
No, they stopped making that show.
We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Afghani.
Afghani.
No, that's Afghan.
Wait, canine AIDS?
Guys, the Afghanistananies.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Except my warehouse.
Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
What?
Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
[phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Carol Stills.
Your realtor.
[on phone] Hello, Michael?
I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Oh, great.
Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
Oh, great.
To the casino thing?
What?
Michael, Jan's on line two.
Michael?
You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Incidentally, what is the charity?
Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
Bye-bye.
No problemo.
To answer your question...
Yes.
I'd love to go.
I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
And I'll bring the papers, too.
I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Yeah! That's great.
Hi.
Hi.
Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Drink would be good.
Okay.
That's my girlfriend.
She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.
Chili's is great.
[Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.
All-in. [Other players fold their hands]
I'll call.
I have good cards.
No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in.
Flip them.
Wow, bad luck.
Michael?
Hi.
What does that mean?
Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]
Hey, hey.
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Come on, shooter!
All right.
Five.
Hey. I'm leaving.
So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
And you guys have a good time together.
Goodbye.
She seems really nice.
Oh, she's great.
[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Do you need anything?
Should I get water or donuts?
What's going on, Michael?
Office Depot!
Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
The planet Caprica.
It's from Battlestar Galactica.
I am going back to my desk...
Annoying.
Frustrating.
Ass.
Yeah, get them, Creed!
I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
What?
Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.
[on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
[on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan.
Cri-Man-Squa?
F and C, doubletime?
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
Here.
Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
That's really not our job.
[getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
All right.
I'll go.
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
We're having a press conference?
Not! [scoffs]
Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
No.
Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott.
Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.
[snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
Well it isn't ended.  I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.
I don't accept your apology.  The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
I, for starters, I think that you should resign.
You're the head---
You're the head of the company!
Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---
And so you should lose your job!
Fine.
It's non-transferable...
I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.
Everything.
It's just the Scranton Times...
You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
[Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
I'm just saying...
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Cut.
Cut.
Cut.
Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
One day for what?
OK.
Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
No. D-
With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.
No, we're not.
[whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...
...'cause there's no comeback for that.
I'm still furious.
If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Final touch-ups.
Yeah.
I don't know...
Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
[whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
What is so funny?
I'm guessing not.
It's disgusting and demeaning.
Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
What's going on?
I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
I don't think the women in this office -
I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
[on speakerphone] Michael, ...
...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
$300?
Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Look at that one.
Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
[reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
[eating banana] Mm, less than three.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
What a surprise.
Alien
What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
I'm saying that you're being sexist.
Michael.
When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Can we just get back to work?
This is not work talk.
Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Thank you, Michael.
What do you want to dish about?
Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Oh, it can be fun.
It's a pretty common one.
Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Oh, my God.
That is not healthy behavior.
Michael, you need to get out of this.
No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
Read the pros first.
OK, OK. Um, cons.
What was the last one?
No, the one before that.
Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
My mom taught me that.
No one said it has no calories.
Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
[wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
[in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Don't answer it.
Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
I think I've got it.
I don't think we really need that, Michael.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
Good luck, Michael.
OK, remember, be strong.
Don't leave a -
Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
So... we're good?
[cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Oh. [door closes]
So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Wait, wait, what cartoons?
[Sigh]
I will never be your vichyssoise.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Idiot.
OK, where does it hurt?
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
[reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.'
The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Michael?
David Wallace is on line one.
The CFO? Ohh...
OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
[on phone] Michael, I am calling---
Jan is out of town right now.
Michael?
Michael?
Michael?
I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
That's not necessary.
Yes.
Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
It's Beach Day...
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
Thanks Toby.
I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
[singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Oh, sweet mother of God.
Excuse me?
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
I hope there will be management parables.
Like what?
Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
Everyone put on sunscreen.
What?
Yes!
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
I choose Michael!
OK, temp.
Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
I don't care what you call my team.
No [crosses arms], the blue team.
We will be team U.S.A.
Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
When's the contest?
How am I supposed to... get...
Thanks a bunch.
A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
Can I have a turkey burger?
It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Is there any mustard?
No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
[eating hot dog] What is it?
You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Can we just take those first two things?
You're leaving?
Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
One came up.
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
Get 'em big boy!
What are you doing?
[Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Angela!
I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
I really doubt it, Michael.
I don't!
How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
I'd like to try it.
But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Nope.
Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
That's harsh.
Why don't you go Michael?
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Do you want us to count to three?
Three. Two. One.
One. Two. Three!  Go! Do it!  Go, Michael.
On the go that's after three.
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
Aggggh, that stings!
Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
Who's Bob Hope?
Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
[runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.  They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da.  From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. [overlapping singing of the wrong verses] When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!
Nice!
Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Acrimonious.
[Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Um, I forgot my...
Yeah!
Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
If I guess, will you tell me?
Please?
Is that a sumo suit?
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Please tell me. I've been so good...
Please.
Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
Just one.
The torches are lit.
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Okay.
It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
I think they were just having fun.
It tells me nothing.
There's 800 of them!
Okay, all right.
Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
Is there any mustard?
That's what she said!
I do!
I do!
Let's go.
He's gonna throw up.
Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
[in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
[confused] Oh, Michael?
Isn't our interview tomorrow?
You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
In the middle of a work day?
Okay.
We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
I don't think so.
I believe we put you in charge.
Okay, Michael.
I'm really looking forward to our interview.
And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
You wanted to see me?
But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
[cries harder] Thank you, Michael.
[sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
[sobbing] Thank you.
So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Whoops.
Heh.
Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
All right.
Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
You're not sure that you have the job.
Yes you will.
[walks through front door] Michael.
Uh, how are you?
I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
Okay.
Okay.
What do you want me to do?
What about Meredith?
No. She's an alternate.
Been good.
Good.
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
To kinda clear my mind.
It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
What are you gonna do?
Do you want to get back together with her?
Just don't get back together with her.
How can she make you get back together with her?
This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Right.
Do it.
I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
[walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
Cause I'm going to get the job.
Thanks.
Oh, okay.
Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
What happened?
Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
[points at bearded man] Who's that?
Beardy?
I'm gonna introduce myself.
No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
Uh, administrative assistant.
I think she's comin' in... later.
Sure.
Okay.
I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Michael, good to see you!
Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Okay.  And your strengths?
Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
What do you think we could be doing better?
Okay!
Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
It is always a treat when our paths cross.
You're back together.
Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
Hey you!
How was your interview?
Yeah?
Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
What?
What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
[opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Yeah!
Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
No, we're not giving you the job.
I do.
Yes.
Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
[sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
How'd it go?
No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
To intimidate my subordinates.
It was Andy's idea.
I don't do that stuff anymore.
No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.
Did... Karen get the job?
Where do you see yourself in ten years?
A... multivitamin?
Michael, what happened?
Home is where the
How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
Michael, you were expecting me, right?
Are you wearing anything under the robe?
This looks great, Michael.
Yes, please.
... Square is fine.
So, what do you say we get started?
I'm full.
I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
No, I know you are.
Just let me have... Oh.
Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, he does. He does.
You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
I think you should get dressed.
Michael, that seems impossible.
We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Great.
No. What? Why?
No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
Okay.
We'll find him.
Really?
We have an investor already?
Michael, that's fantastic.
I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
Next on the list - open the mail.
No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Next on the list --  song parodies.
Great. Let's sing it in the car.
Yeah.
We have a meeting with an investor today.
Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Yes. Yes, it's possible.
Michael! What's going on?
Hey, you.
This wasn't on the list.
No.
It's not.
[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
What size shoes are you guys?
No.
What is he doing?
Oh my God.
Where is it?
Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
It was indescribable.
Michael!
People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
So let's hear it.
How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
What's your mission statement?
Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
Michael, I don't know about this.
I'm not so sure.
We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.
This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!
I love you, Michael. I do.
Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
I can't do this.
I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
Yeah.
So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]
You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
I could work here. I could see this.
Are you good?
I'm good.
Michael, you're back.
Mmmhmm.
Morning Michael!
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
What should we do now?
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Hey buddy.
What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Shut up!
Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Oh yeah I bet.
Michael, we can hear you.
Come on! Ryan!
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
Definitely.
Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
.... Corner idea?
Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
I thought that was your corner.
So my corner's the one with the copier?
I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
It's really cute.
She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Are we staying til five?
Yes.
Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Hey.
Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
That's as specific as I'd like to be.
These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
Keep going. [Whispers]
We already offered free delivery!
Write it down.
A guarantee of what?
And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Oh!
Oh!
We did it !
She did it!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]
Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
They have some great kitchen ideas.
It's small, I know.
Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Michael, you know I can't take this.
But don't forget you owe me $10.
I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
I'm not gonna do that.
I can get there.
Oh, awesome.
[sighs] It's firm.
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Good, do you see what I'm saying?
No.
No.
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
It is the situation that we are in now.
I'm not a barbarian.
I will.
Yes?
I've said too much.
Okay.
[Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
No, Mich-Michael.
Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
Yes.
We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
I. Understand. Nothing.
Michael, are you alright?
Yeah.
We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
[on phone] Dwight Schrute.
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Michael!
Finally.
Dammit! [hangs up]
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
I would like to arrange a truce.
Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Michael.
In which direction?
At what time?
That-
[looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
Michael.
You were making me do things that were not all right.
And not come through for you?
I want a truce.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
I had fish yesterday.
Damn it.
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
I hit a bear.
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Did you enjoy your lunch?
No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Me.
I broke it.
Yes.
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Sure. That'd be fine.
This is war and that is what happens.
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
Michael! Michael!
Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Michael, good to see you.
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
Really?
Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
Dwight, I'm in a meeting.
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Come on.
Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
Uh, ok, sure.
Excuse me?
How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Uncle Dave?
Get off my ass, you hag.
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Do you drink this every day?
Every morning.
Been there, done that.
Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
Come along, afterthought.
Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--
Then you can't afford to pay him anything.
Your prices are too low.
But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.
Okay.
As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care...
...business expansion--
At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make.
They're actually putting you out of business.
It's a program.  There's no such thing--
Did it help?
Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
You want to hear something sad?
I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
You've never had Pad Thai.
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Actually here for something else.
He's bluffing, Pam.
Oh!
Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Missed the last part.
Got it.
Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
That we're having any problem at all.
Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
No, Michael.
We have to come from a position of strength.
Just put it out of your mind.
It is.  I'm good.
Hi.
Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Michael, you  haven't even heard--
$12,000.00
Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
$60,000.00
So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.
Yeah, discuss these things--
Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
They don't make them anymore.
That's very kind of you to say, David.
No.
Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
Pam's not a salesperson.
Okay.  Please continue.
Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Your company cannot be worth that much.
Michael--
Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
Alright!
Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!
Hey, guys--
At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
[whispering] Who is it?
[whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
[after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Okay.
People are dressed inappropriately.
Can you give us a hint?
When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
Do I still have a job here?
How is that going to work?
Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
I call foul, sir.
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Oh, thanks, man.
Thank, Michael.
That one's great.
You look so classy in that picture.
Hey, you have a second?
Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
Tough.
This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
Mm-hmmm.
What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Chiklis style.
Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
Want to play a game?
Lunch.
A restaurant.
I had Mexican food.
That looks great.
I can eat.
It's pony.
Dijonnaise.
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Me too.
No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
You want us to apologize to you?
That's completely backwards.
Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
I'll do--
I'll do the best I can.
Deceit does not come easy to me.
You look like J-Lo.
Are you giving us our clients back?
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
So?
That's fair.
I don't know.
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Challenge.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Well, that's--
Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
He definitely stole my iPod.
You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Mm-hmm.
That's not true.
I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
And I won't.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Take it easy.
Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
Just tell me.
No, okay.
Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
I did?
For real, you're not kidding?
I did?
Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't
What about Ryan?
Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
Thanks, Michael.
Erin.
[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Hi.
Have a seat.
Oh, I can go.
Oh!
Is--do the people--
Oh!
Do they not like me, though?
Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
[caught by camera crew dancing to 'At the Car Wash', but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
I do.
Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Just sent it.
What about the rest of you? [complete silence]
At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Work.
Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Well, I like to swim.
You have a cool place to come hang.
Thanks.
Wow.
Now I do got it.
Oh, yeah.
That's rule #1.
Whew.
I love it.
Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.
Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
[baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.
Yes.
No.
What?
That makes sense.
Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
It's like a haunted disco.
It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
It's a cafe disco.
So, like, a disco cafe?
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Yeah.
Yeah. This place is great.
I'm sorry.
Come.
Kevin, come.
Kevin, come.
Come on, right now.
[to Michael] Is there a cookie?
Wha -
Completely unacceptable.
Mmm-hmm.
Hi.
Hey. I like.
Oh! Mother ******!
Back!
[moans in pain]
Wow! Sorry!
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
It's my back.
Call a doctor.
No. Call Bob.
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
What do you think history is?
It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Oh, my God! What happened?
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
What happened to Phyllis?
Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Yes.
Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls.
I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
I hear it, too, Boss.
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Stop!
No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
No. You need to sign them all.
Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
We're gonna stay.
Yeah. At least for one more dance.
Yeah.
Just go down, Kevin.
Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
[silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
You had to be there.
Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Michael, isn't that Holly?
Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
All right.
Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Hey Michael.
Lemonade sounds great.
I'd love an iced tea, actually.
You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
Come on, folks!
We're designing a house.
For us.
I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
You guys are really gonna do this?
You bet your fat ass we are.
Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
[in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
[to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go!
[gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Dun-der. Dun-der...
Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Oh.
Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
SlumDunder Mifflinaire! [laughter]
Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
[now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
I'm Robert Dunder.
Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
That is correct!
The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
[pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
They didn't know?
How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Hindsight.
How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
There weren't any laughs.
Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Well, I'm glad we did it.
I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but...
[laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
Michael. [they shake hands]
[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].
[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
[taping desk] She's gonna be so psyched.
Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Just the two of us.
Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Oh.
[cheerfully] Okay.
And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
I would have chosen the 1490's.
Cause America was discovered.
[at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Yeah I love that.
What?
Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Here we go. Hot plate.
Why wouldn't he tell me that?
They had sex?
Yes?
Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles.
Uhhhh, they were engaged?
[face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh...
[moans, pulls hair over her face]
In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
[breathes heavily, groans]
[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!
Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
Specific shout-out..
[throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
[sitting on bench outside groaning]
Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
I can't trust Andy anymore.
It's Andy's fault.
Oh, I like his butt.
You tricked me!
But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
Your office is full of genitalia.
That's what he says?'
Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
How are you?
[laughing] Oh, stop that.
Hi. How are you?
There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Hold on one second.
What?
None of this is time sensitive.
Oh, yeah, thank you.
That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
Who took the photo?
Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
[giggles] Not bad.
Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
Yeah. [chuckles]
What's that?
I don't... I don't think so.
I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
You want one?
It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
Well, why don't you shut up!
Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
I think it's over, man.
Ehh.
Nobody's for.
I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Wait.
Michael. Michael.
Michael.
No.
I do find that offensive, actually.
Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
Thank you. Did I... get everything?
Yeah, I think so.
No, it's just in the lot, so...
You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.
Bye.
I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
Bye-bye!
Okay.
Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Yeah.
No.
Michael...
She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
I'm sorry.
Michael! [sighs]
[still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
No, y-you were... right.
You were right.
You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
I'm sor...
No... [they kiss again]
Kelly got into the minority training program.
Oh, Michael.
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Michael, come on.
Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
I have an idea for your weekend.
Let me get back to my desk right now.
Stanley got to go.
Walk around apple orchards.
Super romantic.
Eel fishing.
You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
That is right. Don't make any more of it.
How what?
You could start by concluding this meeting.
How many dates have you been on?
Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Sorry, dude.
Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
You do?
But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
That's what makes it so wrong.
Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
$100 a day, plus expenses.
I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Oh, my God
You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Helene.
My mother.
My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]
You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
Put your fingers here.
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
People who don't trust egg whites.
Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
I am not paying for that membership.
Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Yeah.
How could you think I would cheat on you?
That's pathetic.
When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
I told you I like you.
Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
We're going.
Isn't that something?
Hey, Michael.
I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
And...
No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
What?
I don't know who he is.
What?
You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
You have to settle down first.
Okay. Okay. Yes.
Yeah, but you have to calm...
Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
[to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
Yeah, we should.
Yeah.
Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
Oh, Friday doesn't work.
Shoot. I'm working.
Well, won't you be at the concert?
Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
How do you know?
I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
What, what do you mean?
It's you. I'm married.
This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]
Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
Please sit down.
YEAH! [laughter]
That's... not okay.
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Mm-mm.
Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
I don't wanna do this.
Yeah, that works. That works!
Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]
Michael, nice tie or something.
That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Boi-oi-oi-ing
Exactly. It happened in Big.
Hey Michael.
We can order in from Hooters.
Billy Joel Rock Band.
Yes.
[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Oh Michael.
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
That is something I would never do.
I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Okay.
How does he feel about it?
Now you're just being hurtful.
Hey!
Did Donna tell you that?
So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
So... here's the thing about infidelity.
How does that work?
In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
Not this time.
This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
Baseball!
Where?
Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
I know it's like cricket.
And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
Seems pretty well liked by the team.
You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
Great game, coach.
Ha. The other guys can go die.
Baseball! Go talk to him.
But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
Come on, get over here.
Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going.
Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
Thanks, Michael.
Why would you throw something wet at me?
Now, were those for the team?
I don't think those were yours to take.
Did you talk to him?
Was there a fistfight?
And it didn't change your mind.
Michael, that's awful.
Yes.
Yeah. That's pretty bad.
How can you live with yourself?
That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
[Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Are you gonna add any more?
He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!
For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Why not your condo?
Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
Michael Scott?
Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
[high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  [normal voice] It's Packer!
OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.
What's number one?
So instead of working, you want...
Okay.
Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.
Can you now?
[as Gabe hands out forms to everyone] It's a little form, says 'I did not do it.'
All that's just birthday information, Michael.
Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say?
So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?
Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay.
Well, I guess we're all right, Michael.
Yeah.
Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Well, buy property. That's my advice.
Uh...
I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
Okay? I, I... didn't do it.
I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
I don't care, that's how much I swear!
I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
No.
Oh, god, Darryl!
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
That fast?
Oh.
[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
All right, this is just messed up.
All right.
We're not going for yogurt.
Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Thank you, Erin. Woof!
Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
Basement office? You mean like a lair?
Michael.
Michael Scott... what do you know?
What?
If it doesn't matter, then tell me.
Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak. [Jo's dog barks] Come with me.
[as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
But... [Dwight closes phone]
Michael.
Let's just talk.
Honey, you don't seem like your normal self.
Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Oh, I hate that.
Who's Holly?
When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me.
I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.
Oh honey, surely you don't want that.
Yeah.
Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.
I hope your rough patch ends soon.
Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.
Yes, and this happens every...?
Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
Thanks.
Yep, okay...
Okay.
Stay in bed!
Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Uh, leave it at the door or...?
Yeah that's fine.
Is this an employee of ours?
[giggles] Go go go go go go!
It reminds me of Katrina.
Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
[whispers] I'm not going in there.
[quietly shuts the door] Go.
Oh hey, didn't see you.
I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.
The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Every day is black tie optional!
You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
Yeah that's great.
Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...
[whispers to Michael] Michael, I'm very, very bad.
You are doing it.
Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
This did not happen.
Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Where were you on September 11th?
Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
[laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo's stomach bouncing up and down in Michael's office] Me mo. Me mo.
Meee Mo, Mee!
When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]
[bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!
Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.
This was not, part of the job description!
Who am I doing this for?
I can't. [Michael slaps him again]
Stop, hitting me.
Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more]
It's showtime.
Alright, here we go.
Nope, go back to the script.
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Didn't I?
Big smiles folks! There they are.
How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
[stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
Damn that was cold.
THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!
Michael, are we?!
We're done. We're done!
Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
[with Dwight and Michael outside Michael's car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Okay, fine I'll hold it.
I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
[as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
[very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]
He is in an all-out sprint.
A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
[starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.
[recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!
Come on Toby.
[walking up] Michael?
I've got a treat for you!
Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
[angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Great idea.
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
[with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
That's nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?
You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
I will be in the break room.
Dead man walking.
Everything.
[to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Yeah that was a surprise...
[surprised] Okay.
Should we get toppings?
[confused] What?
Hot fudge?
Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]
[holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
Please Michael.
[holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
It's cute. [plays with it]
Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
What does that even mean?
I'm gonna lose 'em.
I promise you that I will.
I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]
Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Oh...
Better...
But...
Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
[laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
It was just you...
State Senator.
You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
[Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
You have an address yet in Colorado?
What town do Holly's parents live in?
[to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
You sure?
I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
[on phone] Hello there!
Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
[Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
[deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
I love you too.
Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
[smiling] Okay.
[doing make up and irritated] What?!
Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
This is... totally unnecessary.
No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
Well, no. He hates jams.
Hey.
That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
No. Can't let you do that Mike.
No problem. Worth a try.
No.
Not while I'm driving.
I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Andy.
I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
I'm not attracted to Kevin.
[nods] Extension 147.
I know.
[on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Yes.
[opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
[Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
[smiles knowingly]
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
[walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
[in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
[sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
We did it!
Yes, what is this about?
Mmhmmm.
They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Is that it?
Is that it?
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Alright.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
[chuckles] You got it.
Oh no, they're still not done.
[drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Later guys. [leaves the office]
Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can't believe you came.
If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We'll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won't we?
