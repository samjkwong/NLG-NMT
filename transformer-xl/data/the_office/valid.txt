Michael: [at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!
David: [confused] Oh, Michael?
Michael: Are we all set?
David: Isn't our interview tomorrow?
Michael: Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
David: You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Michael: Thought I'd catch a show.
David: In the middle of a work day?
Michael: Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
David: Okay.
Michael: Um, how many people are you interviewing?
David: We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
Michael: Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
David: I don't think so.
Michael: Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
David: I believe we put you in charge.
Michael: Ah, great. No further questions.
David: Okay, Michael.
Michael: Okay.
David: I'm really looking forward to our interview.
Michael: And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
Michael: I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
Kevin: [Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Jim: Hey, Kev.
Kevin: What's different about you? You look worse.
Jim: Thank you.
Meredith: You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
Jim: Ohhh...
Meredith: Turn around.
Jim: No.
Meredith: Yes.
Jim: No way.
Meredith: Do it!
Andy: Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Jim: [exhales loudly] Andy...
Andy: What is it, Big Haircut?
Jim: Nothing.
Andy: Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.
Jim: Yup.
Andy: What?
Jim: Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Pam: Hey. I think it looks great.
Jim: Thanks, Pam.
Pam: After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Michael: [knock on door] Yeah.
Dwight: You wanted to see me?
Michael: Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight: But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
Michael: Okay. Uh...
Dwight: [cries harder] Thank you, Michael.
Michael: Uh, okay.
Dwight: [sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
Michael: Stop crying.
Dwight: [sobbing] Thank you.
Michael: Ohhhhh...
Pam: Hey.
Karen: Hey.
Pam: Um, about the beach...
Karen: It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
Pam: Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
Karen: [confused] Oh. Okay.
Karen: Pam is... kind of a bitch.
Karen: Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
Jim: Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Jim: So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Michael: Why so you can do it?
Karen: [looks annoyed]
Jim: Whoops.
Michael: No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Jim: Hmmm.
Karen: Heh.
Michael: Moon each other.
Jim: Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Michael: All right.
Jim: All right.
Michael: Your loss.
Karen: Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Michael: Cruise control.
Karen: Oh.
Kevin: So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Jim: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
Kevin: Pam is taller.
Jim: You sure?
Kevin: Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
Jim: Wow.
Kevin: I think Karen has a prettier face.
Jim: Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
Kevin: Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Jim: Hm. Really tough call.
Kevin: Yeah.
Jim: You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Kevin: Will do.
Jim: All right. [smiles]
Oscar: Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Pam: Wow, very funny.
Stanley: I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Kelly: Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Pam: [smiles]
Meredith: You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
Creed: I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Creed: www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
Ryan: Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
Michael: There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
Kevin: Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Michael: No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Oscar: Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Michael: No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Oscar: Michael...
Kevin: What?
Angela: Why?
Oscar: I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
Michael: Yes, I...
Angela: Wha? Who gave you that advice?
Kevin: Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Michael: I have to buy another place.
Angela: But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
Oscar: You're not sure that you have the job.
Michael: I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
Dwight: How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
Angela: No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
Dwight: No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
Angela: [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
Dwight: [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Jim: Oh hey, Dwight.
Dwight: I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
Jim: Does my room have cable?
Dwight: No. And the sheets are made of fire.
Jim: Can I change rooms?
Dwight: Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Jim: Can I have a late checkout?
Dwight: I'll have to talk to the manager.
Jim: You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Dwight: I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
Jim: Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Dwight: Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
Jim: Go.
Dwight: Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Dwight: Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Andy: [signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
Dwight: Yes you will.
Michael: Who is D. Abramson?
Pam: He's from that company in Pitts...
Jan: [walks through front door] Michael.
Michael: Why... are you here?
Jan: Uh, how are you?
Michael: I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Jan: I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Michael: Why privately?
Jan: I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
Michael: Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Jan: Okay.
Michael: Okay.
Michael: Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Pam: What do you want me to do?
Michael: Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
Pam: What about Meredith?
Michael: No. She's an alternate.
Michael: So, how you been?
Jan: Been good.
Michael: Good.
Jan: Good.
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
Michael: Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
Pam: So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Karen: Cause of Jan again?
Karen: Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
Pam: Uh, sure.
Karen: Thanks.
Pam: I really hope you get the job.
Karen: Thanks. [looks suspicious]
Jan: After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Michael: Hmm.
Jan: To kinda clear my mind.
Michael: Sound good. Sounds fun.
Jan: It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Michael: Hmm..
Jan: I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Michael: Would you excuse me for a second?
Jan: Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Michael: Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
Phyllis: What are you gonna do?
Michael: I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
Karen: Do you want to get back together with her?
Michael: No, no. What do I do?
Pam: Just don't get back together with her.
Michael: What if she makes me?
Angela: How can she make you get back together with her?
Michael: She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
Pam: This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Michael: I wasn't.
Pam: You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Michael: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Pam: Right.
Michael: Wow.
Karen: Do it.
Michael: I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
Michael: [walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
Michael: Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Pam: Oh my God. [mouths to Jim]
Jim: Yeah, bigger actually.
Pam: [whispers] That's crazy!
Jim: Mm-hm.
Pam: [mouths] Wow!
Karen: [moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Jim: Unbelievable.
Karen: Wow!
Jim: She could put the cup right there.
Karen: I know!
Pam: No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Meredith: I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Kevin: I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Creed: I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
Jan: So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Michael: First got priorities.
Jan: And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Michael: Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
Michael: No.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you this, it is
Dwight: Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
Andy: Saving the best for first!
Karen: All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Dwight: No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Oscar: Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
Dwight: What did I say!?
Pam: [to Jim] Good luck.
Jim: Thanks.
Pam: I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
Dwight: I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
Andy: White, because it contains all other colors.
Dwight: Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
Andy: You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
Dwight: What is the capital of Maine?
Andy: The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Dwight: Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Andy: Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
Dwight: You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Andy: I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
Andy: I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
Dwight: [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
Andy: Damn it!
Dwight: This interview is over. I'll let you know.
Karen: [Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Jim: Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Karen: Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Jim: Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Karen: No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
Jim: Oh...
Karen: Cause I'm going to get the job.
Michael: [holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.
Jan: Thanks.
Michael: Wait, wait. Check one more time.
Jan: Oh, okay.
Michael: Very good [Jan nods]
Jan: Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Michael: Yes, indeed.
Jan: Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
Michael: So, I guess we're getting back together.
Pam: What happened?
Michael: Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
Michael: Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
Karen: So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Jim: Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
Karen: How often do you come here?
Jim: Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Karen: I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Michael: Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
Dwight: [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
Jim: [Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Karen: That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Karen: So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Jim: Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Karen: Well,
Jim: You mean Kevin?
Karen: Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Jim: Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Michael: [exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
Karen: Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
Michael: I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
Jim: [points at bearded man] Who's that?
Michael: That
Jim: Beardy?
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Jim: I'm gonna introduce myself.
Michael: No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
Michael: I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Dwight: Michael is gone.
Andy: Hail to the chief!
Dwight: My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
Andy: My first order of business: accept.
Dwight: As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
Andy: Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
Michael: Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Hunter: Uh, administrative assistant.
Michael: Jan in yet?
Hunter: I think she's comin' in... later.
Michael: Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Hunter: Sure.
Michael: Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means.
Hunter: Okay.
Michael: Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?
Dwight: You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
Pam: Thank you.
Dwight: I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Pam: Really?
Dwight: Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Pam: You will be your own assistant.
Dwight: Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Pam: Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
Dwight: Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: Do you accept?
Pam: Absolutely, I do.
Pam: I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Michael: [knocks on door] Hello, hello!
David: Michael, good to see you!
Michael: Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
David: Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Michael: Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
David: Okay.  And your strengths?
Michael: Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
David: Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Michael: Thank you.
David: Very good.
Phyllis: Dwight is our new boss.
Oscar: Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
Pam: Then who do you think will get the job?
Kevin: Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Phyllis: I think it's gonna be Michael.
Oscar: Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
Phyllis: No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Oscar: [laughs] Mm.  Yeah.
Dwight: Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Pam: [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Dwight: Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
Oscar: So ten
Dwight: Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Stanley: Amen.
Dwight: Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
Kevin: [raises hand] Do we have to?
Dwight: Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Pam: I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
David: What do you think we could be doing better?
Michael: I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.
David: Okay!
Michael: Okay.
David: Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
Michael: Thank you.
David: It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Michael: It is always a treat when
David: You're back together.
Michael: Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
David: Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
Michael: I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
David: No, we're letting Jan go.
Dwight: Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground
Kevin: [at the same time as Dwight] Trees.
Dwight: Trees!  And where do trees grow?
Kevin: [at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
Dwight: Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Stanley: Liquid.
Dwight: Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Stanley: I don't want it.
Dwight: Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Stanley: Make it 100.
Dwight: We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
Stanley: No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
Dwight: What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Stanley: The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
Dwight: Okay---
Andy: That's it!
Dwight: What---
Andy: Class is canceled, everybody out!
Dwight: No wait, what are you doing?!
Andy: I'm punishing them.
Dwight: No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
Everyone: [grumbling, getting loud]
Pam: HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
Oscar: What--- What are you winking for?
Dwight: Zip your lid!
Karen: So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
David: Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
Karen: Yeah?
David: ...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Karen: He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
David: This is off the record.
Karen: He would be disaster.
Jan: Hey you!
Michael: Hey.
Jan: How was your interview?
Michael: Pretty good.
Jan: Yeah?
Michael: Could have gone better I guess.
Jan: Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
Michael: Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Jan: What?
Michael: Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
Jan: What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Michael: I can't tell you.
Jan: Tell me what?
Jan: You son of a bitch!
David: Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Jan: You're
David: Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Jan: Erratic?
David: Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
Jan: [opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
Michael: Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Jan: No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
David: It's not.
Jan: No?
David: It's not.
Jan: Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
David: The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Michael: Hey!
Jan: Yeah!
Michael: No--- We're all unstable.
Jan: Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
Michael: David, I did not tell her.
Andy: It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
Dwight: It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
Andy: This is gonna look so awesome!
Dwight: It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Andy: [laughs] Totally!
Jan: [giving a hug] Bye Hunter.
Hunter: Bye.
Jan: Good luck with your band.
Hunter: Oh, thank---
Jan: Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Michael: So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
David: Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
Michael: Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
David: No, we're not giving you the job.
Michael: You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
David: I do.
Michael: Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
David: Yes.
Michael: Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.
Karen: Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Jim: Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
Karen: Don't!  She's nuts! [they laugh]
Jim: Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Karen: Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Jim: Okay.
Karen: Just call me when you're done.
Jim: Sure.
Karen: Good luck, Halpert.
Jim: Thank you.
Receptionist: [phone rings, picks up] Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace.  Sure.
Jan: Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Michael: I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
Jan: Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
Michael: Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
Jan: [sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
Michael: [whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
Jan: Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Michael: [in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
Pam: How'd it go?
Michael: No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
Michael: Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
Dwight: To intimidate my subordinates.
Michael: That's stupid.
Dwight: It was Andy's idea.
Michael: You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.
Ryan: I don't do that stuff anymore.
Michael: No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.
Michael: So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
Pam: Did... Karen get the job?
Michael: [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
Dwight: Pam, hello.
Pam: Dwight, hello.
Dwight: I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
Pam: No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
David: I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Jim: I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
David: Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
Jim: Thanks.
David: Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
Jim: I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
David: Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
Jim: Yes, absolutely.
David: And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
Jim: Oh, no, absolutely.
David: ...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
Jim: [hands David his papers] There you go.
David: How do you think you function here in New York?
Jim: [not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
David: You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
Jim: [thinks] The friendships.
David: Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Jim: [flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Pam: Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh]
Jim: The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
Pam: I know.
Jim: And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Pam: Well, I wish you would.
Pam: [phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Pam: I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
Jim: Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Pam: Yes.
Jim: All right.  Then... it's a date.
Pam: [to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
David: [on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
Ryan: [on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
Kelly: Who was that?
Ryan: [still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Kelly: What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
David: Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Michael: Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
David: A... multivitamin?
Michael: Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
Phyllis: Michael, what happened?
Michael: Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Oscar: Home is where the
Michael: Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!
Kelly: Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Pam: Mmm-hmm. [nods]
Kelly: But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
Pam: Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
Kelly: Pam, he's just not that into you.
Pam: Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
Kelly: No, seriously Pam, wake up.
Pam: Okay.
Pam: Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
Dwight: Define scorched earth policy.
Andy: When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...
Dwight: Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
Andy: It is the source of all energy on this planet.
Dwight: Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
Andy: I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
Dwight: Who was the second man on the moon?
Andy: Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
Dwight: Inventor of the cotton gin.
Andy: Eli Edison.
Dwight: Talk me through an appendectomy.
Andy: Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.
Dwight: Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
Andy: Re-suture.  Sutures, yes.
Dwight: When is the Paleolithic Age?
Andy: 17 B.C.
Dwight: What is a scented candle?
Dwight: How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Michael: New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.
Michael: It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
Michael: [honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!
Ryan: We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Michael: Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.
Pam: We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
Pam: You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Michael: Milk and sugar.
Pam: Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Michael: That's what I said.
Pam: Do you drink this every day?
Michael: Every morning.
Michael: We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
Pam: [an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
Charles: Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?
Jim: Oh, they're my client.
Charles: No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
Dwight: [sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
Charles: In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
Stanley: What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Charles: I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Andy: Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
Charles: Why are you telling me this?
Andy: I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
Charles: Is this something you really want to have said?
Andy: I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
Charles: I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
Dwight: It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
Charles: I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
Angela: Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
Charles: Uh, well said, Angela.
Dwight: Been there, done that.
Michael: You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
Ryan: Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Michael: Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
Pam: Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Michael: Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
Pam: Yeah, I know what a loft is.
Ryan: Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
Michael: Most do in the magazines.
Ryan: Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
Michael: We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
David Wallace: Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
Jim: Hey, David.
Dwight: David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
Charles: There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
David: A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
Charles: Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
David: Hmmm.
Charles: I feel like I should be thanking you.
David: Uh.
Jim: [makes kissing, puckering sound]
Charles: The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
David: You know, I just want to address everyone first.
Charles: Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
David: Hi, everyone.
Kelly: Hi.
David: Hi.  Uh, look it's no secret--
Kevin: Hi.
David: Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Charles: Right.
David: Okay?
Phyllis: Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
David: I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
Charles: Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
David: Hmm.
Charles: Yeah, Jim--
David: I find that extraordinarily surprising.
Charles: He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
David: We'll bring them both in.
Charles: Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
Dwight: Come along, afterthought.
Michael: How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Financial Guy: Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--
Michael: They are correct, sir.
Financial Guy: Then you can't afford to pay him anything.
Michael: Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
Financial Guy: Your prices are too low.
Michael: Lowest in town.
Financial Guy: Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?
Pam: Corporate greed?
Ryan: Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Financial Guy: Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct.
Ryan: Yeah.
Financial Guy: But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.
Michael: Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
Ryan: Explain what you think that is.
Financial Guy: Okay.
Michael: Explain that.
Financial Guy: As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care...
Michael: Well, we don't--
Financial Guy: ...business expansion--
Michael: Whatever, yeah.
Financial Guy: At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make.
Michael: Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Financial Guy: They're actually putting you out of business.
Michael: Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Ty: It's a program.  There's no such thing--
Michael: Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.
Ty: [presses key on computer] Crunch.
Pam: Did it help?
Michael: Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
Pam: When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
Jim: Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
Charles: God, no.
Dwight: Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
Charles: I agree.
Dwight: I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
Jim: Really? Does he do good work or--
Dwight: [scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
David: Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
Dwight: Five minutes exactly.
Charles: Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
Dwight: Sure thing.
Charles: Yeah.
Jim: [opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
Jim : You're just out of business?
Pam: We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Jim: Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
Pam: That's what Michael said.
Jim: Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
Pam: I like it.
Jim: Good, right?  Hello.
Dwight: [over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Jim: Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Michael: Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Pam: Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
Michael: I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.
Pam: You want to hear something sad?
Michael: I would love that.
Pam: So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
Ryan: I never went to Thailand.
Pam: Really?
Ryan: I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Michael: Was it nice?
Ryan: Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Michael: I love Pad Thai.
Ryan: You've never had Pad Thai.
Michael: No.  There's a lot I haven't done.
Jim: Now, this is the projection over three months?
Charles: We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
Dwight: Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
David: Yeah, yeah.
Dwight: There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
David: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Charles: Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
Jim: Oh, but you didn't.
Dwight: Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
Charles: What is wrong with you?
David: Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Jim: Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
David: Yeah.
Jim: I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Dwight: You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
Charles: No, Jim... I think you should go.
Jim: Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
Michael: [knocking on door] Hmm?
Jim: Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Michael: We're not hiring, Jim.
Jim: Actually here for something else.
Michael: Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
Jim: You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Ryan: Oh, that's nice.
Jim: David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Pam: Seriously?  Are you being serious?
Ryan: He's bluffing, Pam.
Michael: Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
Jim: Oh!
Michael: No-- We don't have--
Jim: Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Michael: [stammers] Uh... Yes.
Pam: Yes.
Ryan: Maybe.
Jim: Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Michael: Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
Jim: Missed the last part.
Michael: That's a pun.
Jim: Got it.
Michael: Yep. Oh... wow.
Ryan: Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Michael: Of course not.
Ryan: That we're having any problem at all.
Michael: Nope, nope, nope.
Pam: Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Michael: Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
Michael: Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
Pam: No, Michael.
Michael: Ah...
Ryan: No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Pam: We have to come from a position of strength.
Michael: I'm good, I'm good.
Ryan: Just put it out of your mind.
Michael: It is.  I'm good.
Michael: Hello.
Erin: Hi.
Michael: Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables...
David: Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Michael: And we are prepared to reject that offer.
Ryan: Michael, you  haven't even heard--
Michael: Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
David: $12,000.00
Michael: Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
Angela: What do you hear?
Kelly: [mumbles]
David: Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Michael: I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
David: Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Michael: [stutters] We'll have to talk--
Charles: What?
Ryan: We'll have to talk about this.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Just amongst ourselves.
David: Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
Michael: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Pam: $60,000.00
Michael: We are so rich.
Pam: Are you kidding me?
Dwight: Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
Charles: Dwight.
Dwight: May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
Charles: What?  How'd you hear that?
Dwight: They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
Jim: Great work Dwight.
Dwight: Quiet you.
Jim: No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Dwight: You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Charles: So how long can they stay viable?
Jim: What are your top five cases?
Dwight: I'm gonna answer Charles first.
Jim: Because you've solved zero cases.
Dwight: Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
Charles: Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
Dwight: Done.
Charles: Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
Dwight: I'm not-- I'm not following you.
Charles: You two are morons.
Jim: Got it.
Dwight: Wh--
Charles: Get out.
David: So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
Michael: No.
Pam: Can you give us another minute please?
David: Yeah.
Charles: Oh, okay.
Pam: Michael.
Ryan: How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
Pam: Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
Michael: It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
Ryan: I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
Pam: No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.
Michael: Agreed?
Pam: Agreed.  But that's all, okay.
Ryan: Yeah, discuss these things--
Michael: Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
Michael: I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
Charles: They don't make them anymore.
Michael: And I want Charles gone.
David: I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
Charles: That's very kind of you to say, David.
Michael: I need him gone.
David: No.
Michael: Okay, then I want Pam back.
David: Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
Michael: Sales.
Pam: Thank you.
David: Pam's not a salesperson.
Michael: Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
Pam: That's right.
David: Okay.  Please continue.
Michael: And Ryan.
David: Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Michael: You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
David: Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Michael: And dental this time.
David: Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Michael: These are our demands.
David: Your company cannot be worth that much.
Michael: Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
David: Michael--
Michael: That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
David: Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
Michael: Can we have the room please?
David: Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
Ryan: Yes, yes, yes!
Pam: Alright!
Michael: Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!
Michael: There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
Charles: Hey, guys--
Michael: No, no. You're done.
Kevin: At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
Michael: Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
Ryan: [whispering] Who is it?
Pam: [whispering] Who is it?
Michael: [whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
Michael: Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
Dwight: [after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Michael: If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
Angela: Okay.
Michael: Yes.
Angela: People are dressed inappropriately.
Michael: Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
Jim: Can you give us a hint?
Michael: When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
Michael: Oscar, what were you going to say?
Oscar: Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
Michael: All right.
Erin: Do I still have a job here?
Michael: Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
Dwight: Wait, what?
Stanley: How is that going to work?
Michael: It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
Phyllis: You mean the clients you stole from us.
Dwight: Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
Michael: No, you lost those clients.
Andy: I call foul, sir.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Michael: Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.
Meredith: [to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Pam: [laughs]  Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
Phyllis: It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Pam: Well, you have good taste.
Phyllis: Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Pam: What?
Phyllis: Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Pam: Oh, I, um...
Phyllis: Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
Angela: The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Toby: Can't you just not look at his feet?
Angela: Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
Toby: Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Michael: [hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
Ryan: Oh, thanks, man.
Michael: Pamela.
Pam: Thank, Michael.
Michael: Yep.
Dwight: Fresh hot ink.
Stanley: New File System'.
Dwight: Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Stanley: I am not changing the way I do my files.
Dwight: No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Dwight: When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
Oscar: I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
Toby: I could loan you a pair of socks.
Oscar: No.
Toby: No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
Oscar: I don't think so.
Andy: Andrew Bernard.
Dwight: Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
Andy: What are you still doing not at your desk?
Dwight: Did you even read the memo?
Andy: All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Dwight: No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
Andy: Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
Dwight: Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
Dwight: We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Jim: Can I address that?
Dwight: No, you're too close.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Stanley: It's not right.  I don't like it.
Dwight: He doesn't like it.
Phyllis: You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
Dwight: Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
Meredith: I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
Dwight: Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Phyllis: Those sound too harsh.
Dwight: No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Jim: Of course.  What is like a hostage?
Dwight: Excellent question.
Andy: We could write a strong-worded letter.
Dwight: Words will never be enough.
Jim: Strongly-painted picture.
Dwight: No, pictures are too interpretive.
Jim: Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
Dwight: Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
Jim: Great.  See you upstairs.
Dwight: C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
Pam: That one's great.
Michael: I know.
Ryan: You look so classy in that picture.
Michael: I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
Jim: Hey, you have a second?
Michael: Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Jim: Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
Michael: Okay, well---
Ryan: Tough.
Michael: I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Jim: This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Michael: Against who?
Ryan: You.  Us.
Pam: What?
Ryan: It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
Michael: The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
Michael: Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
Pam: Mm-hmmm.
Michael: That was  us, right there.
Pam: We were something else.
Ryan: What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Ryan: Chiklis style.
Michael: Yeah, the Commish.
Ryan: Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
Michael: Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
Creed: It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
Jim: I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--
Creed: Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
Jim: That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.
Creed: Want to play a game?
Michael: Hey gang. Where you been?
Dwight: Lunch.
Michael: Where'd you eat?
Phyllis: A restaurant.
Michael: What'd you have, Stanley?
Andy: I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
Stanley: I had Mexican food.
Michael: So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
Ryan: That looks great.
Michael: Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
Ryan: I can eat.
Michael: I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Dwight: It's pony.
Michael: Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
Andy: Dijonnaise.
Michael: Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
Pam: Mmm.
Toby: Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
Meredith: About what?
Toby: Your outfit.
Meredith: What? What's wrong with my outfit?
Toby: You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
Meredith: A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Oscar: Meredith, your boob is out.
Meredith: Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]
Angela: Meredith, too far!
Kelly: Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
Meredith: It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Creed: [playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
Jim: Well, what if I just do this?
Creed: You don't want to do that.
Jim: I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Ryan: I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Dwight: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
Ryan: Exactly.
Dwight: That's my client.
Ryan: Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Dwight: Give me the phone.
Ryan: Things have been generally good.
Dwight: Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Ryan: Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
Dwight: Hi, Mr. Bart.
Ryan: At these prices with this service...
Dwight: Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
Ryan: You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.
Ryan: No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
Dwight: I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
Phyllis: Ryan, hand the phone over.
Ryan: Stop flustering me, everybody!
Stanley: Who let this boy on the phone?
Dwight: Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Pam: You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
Dwight: You're a secretary! What do you know?
Ryan: Okay.
Dwight: And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Michael: Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
Dwight: We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Michael: Who quits?
Phyllis: Me.
Stanley: And me.
Andy: Me too.
Michael: You guys gotta be kidding.
Dwight: No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Michael: I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  [throws money at Phyllis] There you go.  There's some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
Stanley: You want us to apologize to you?
Michael: Yes I do.
Andy: That's completely backwards.
Michael: It's frontward's.
Phyllis: Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Stanley: That's right.
Dwight: Right.
Phyllis: Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
Michael: No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
Michael: I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Dwight: Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Michael: Whatever you guys did earlier.
Dwight: I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Michael: Just do it, okay?
Dwight: I'll do--
Michael: Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.
Dwight: I'll do the best I can.
Michael: Are you kidding me?
Dwight: Deceit does not come easy to me.
Michael: Okay, okay, okay.
Erin: I really love your outfit.
Kelly: Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Erin: You look like J-Lo.
Michael: So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
Stanley: Are you giving us our clients back?
Michael: If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
Stanley: Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
Michael: They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Phyllis: Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
Michael: Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
Stanley: So?
Michael: Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology.
Dwight: That's fair.
Michael: You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Darryl: What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Ryan: Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Pam: He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
Ryan: I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Pam: Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
Ryan: If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
Pam: Yeah.
Ryan: Thanks.
Creed: So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
Jim: Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
Creed: I thought you were gay.
Jim: Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Creed: I don't know.
Michael: Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Jim: Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Michael: [puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
Creed: Challenge.
Michael: I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
Jim: I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Michael: You're close with Pam too.
Jim: Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Michael: Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
Jim: Well, that's--
Michael: I like his hair.
Jim: Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Michael: Okay.
Jim: He definitely stole my iPod.
Michael: That sounds pretty biased.
Jim: You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Michael: Okay. Pam, pros.
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Michael: I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
Jim: That's not true.
Michael: I don't need to tell you that.
Jim: I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Michael: I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
Jim: And I won't.
Michael: Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
Jim: All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Michael: Oh, wow!  Whoa!
Jim: Take it easy.
Michael: Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
Michael: I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Andy: You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
Toby: All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
Dwight: Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
Toby: All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.
Dwight: No.
Toby: I'm running this meeting.
Dwight: That's debatable.
Toby: It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
Meredith: Ooh, where has this guy been?
Toby: Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
Andy: You're running from the problem.
Toby: There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
Michael: Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
Pam: Just tell me.
Michael: I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
Pam: No, okay.
Michael: I'm sorry, sorry.
Pam: Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
Michael: [laughing] Yes, you did.
Pam: I did?
Michael: Yep.
Pam: For real, you're not kidding?
Michael: No, you--no.
Pam: I did?
Michael: No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
Pam: Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
Michael: [laughing] Oh, oh!
Pam: Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
Michael: You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Pam: Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Michael: Oh, really?
Pam: Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't
Michael: Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
Pam: What about Ryan?
Michael: I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
Pam: Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
Michael: I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
Pam: Thanks, Michael.
Michael: Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Pam: Erin.
Michael: Could you send her in?
Pam: [opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Michael: Hello.
Erin: Hi.
Michael: Have a seat.
Michael: This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
Erin: Oh, I can go.
Michael: He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
Erin: Oh!
Michael: Oh, your face!  Oh!
Erin: Is--do the people--
Michael: No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Erin: Oh!
Michael: Oh...
Erin: Do they not like me, though?
Michael: I don't know, actually.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
Erin: [whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Dwight: Shut up.
Dwight: [laughs hysterically] I got her!
Pam: Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]
Jim: Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
Michael: [caught by camera crew dancing to 'At the Car Wash', but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
Michael: Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Dwight: I do.
Michael: Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Pam: Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Michael: Oh, really? Ok.
Pam: Just sent it.
Michael: What about the rest of you? [complete silence]
Michael: At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Michael: Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Ryan: I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Ryan: Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Michael: Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
Angela: No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Phyllis: Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Michael: What?
Phyllis: Work.
Michael: Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
Pam: If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
Pam: Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
Michael: [still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.
Erin: Hi, guys. How you doing?
Dwight: Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Erin: Right. I'm sorry.
Dwight: [sighs] Now, how can I help you?
Erin: Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Dwight: Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
Pam: So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Dwight: It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Erin: Sure.
Jim: There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Pam: We're getting married today.
Jim: So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Pam: Tell 'em how it happened.
Jim: Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Pam: And very expensive.
Jim: Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Pam: You can't leave anyone out.
Jim: No one.
Pam: Ok, just get to the good part.
Jim: Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Pam: I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
Erin: Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Michael: No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Erin: Well, I like to swim.
Michael: That's good.
Erin: You have a cool place to come hang.
Michael: If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
Erin: Thanks.
Michael: Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Erin: Wow.
Michael: Now you got it.
Erin: Now I do got it.
Michael: Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
Erin: Oh, yeah.
Michael: You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Erin: That's rule #1.
Michael: Ok. I love it. I love it.
Erin: Whew.
Michael: I love it.
Michael: Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Michael: Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.
Michael: Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
Oscar: Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Michael: I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Andy: [baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.
Michael: Andy's afwaid?
Andy: Yes.
Michael: Are you all afwaid?
Dwight: No.
Michael: Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Pam: What?
Michael: Funk is the problem and the solution.
Jim: That makes sense.
Michael: I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Oscar: Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Michael: Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
Dwight: [Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Meredith: This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
Michael: No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
Andy: It's like a haunted disco.
Michael: ... with coffee but without the haunted.
Phyllis: It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
Michael: It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Erin: It's a cafe disco.
Michael: Exactly.
Kevin: So, like, a disco cafe?
Michael: Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Michael: Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Holdin' down the fort.
Kevin: Yeah. This place is great.
Michael: Thank you.
Angela: Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Kevin: I'm sorry.
Michael: This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Kevin: Yeah. Respect the lei.
Angela: Come.
Michael: Kevin, stay.
Angela: Kevin, come.
Michael: Kevin, stay.
Angela: Kevin, come.
Michael: Stay, stay.
Angela: Come on, right now.
Michael: Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Angela: Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
Kevin: [to Michael] Is there a cookie?
Michael: Mmm-hmm.
Angela: Wha -
Michael: Come on.
Angela: Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Kevin: I wanted a cookie.
Angela: Completely unacceptable.
Michael: Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.
Andy: [Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!
Phyllis: Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Jessica: Oh, he's on a call.
Phyllis: Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
Jessica: It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Phyllis: Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Jessica: I'll let him know.
Phyllis: Mmm-hmm.
Michael: Phyllis?
Phyllis: Hi.
Michael: Hey!
Phyllis: Hey. I like.
Michael: [starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Phyllis: Oh! Mother ******!
Michael: Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Phyllis: Back!
Michael: Oh, wow! What did you do?
Phyllis: [moans in pain]
Michael: You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Phyllis: Wow! Sorry!
Michael: Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
Dwight: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
Michael: No. No. No.
Dwight: Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Phyllis: It's my back.
Michael: It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
Phyllis: Call a doctor.
Michael: We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Phyllis: No. Call Bob.
Michael: Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
Dwight: Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Michael: I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
Dwight: What do you think history is?
Michael: It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
Michael: [barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.
Dwight: Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Michael: You having fun?
Erin: Oh, my God! What happened?
Michael: What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
Phyllis: What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Dwight: You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Michael: Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Oscar: What happened to Phyllis?
Michael: Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
Angela: Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Michael: Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
Stanley: I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Michael: You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Erin: Yes.
Michael: I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
Erin: Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Michael: I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
Dwight: [exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Kelly: Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
Erin: You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
Vance Refrigeration Guy 1: There's girl in there.
Vance Refrigeration Guy 2: Where?
VRG 1: The other room?
VRG 2: What other room?
VRG 1: Down the hall.
VRG 2: There's girls in there?
VRG 1: What'd I just say?
VRG 2: You have another sandwich?
VRG 1: Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls.
Michael: I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Dwight: You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Phyllis: Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight: Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Phyllis: I do.
Dwight: No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Andy: Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
Erin: Ashley! You made it!
Oscar: You invited someone?
Erin: Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Oscar: I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Andy: I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
Michael: Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Creed: I hear it, too, Boss.
Michael: It's better than I imagined it!
Phyllis: That feels good, Dwight.
Dwight: Tell me where it hurts.
Phylis: Right... mmmm... right there.
Dwight: Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Michael: Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
Erin: Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
Angela: Stop!
Michael: Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Angela: No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Michael: Oh. Alright. There you go.
Angela: No. You need to sign them all.
Michael: No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
Angela: Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Michael: I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.' [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.
Dwight: This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Phyllis: An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
Dwight: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
Creed: Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Michael: Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
Creed: No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Dwight: I'm gonna with the python.
Phyllis: But the rattler's so scary.
Dwight: No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Phyllis: I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
Dwight: What's so funny?
Phyllis: When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Michael: Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
Angela: You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Michael: No... cleaning... up.
Jim: [waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
Pam: They're beautiful.
Jim: You ready?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
Michael: Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
Phyllis: Wanna dance, Dwight?
Dwight: Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Bob Vance: Mind if I steal my wife?
Dwight: You can't steal what is legally your property.
Bob Vance: Are those staples?
Andy: This dance competition is not over.
Kelly: What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
Michael: You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Jim: We're gonna stay.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah. At least for one more dance.
Michael: Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.
Pam: This is so cheesy.
Jim: Yes.
Pam: I like cheesy.
Jim: Me, too.
Pam: Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
Jim: Me, too.
Pam: Really?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Would you like to dance?
Angela: No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
Andy: Yeah. No. Well, ok.
Kelly: Stop squirming.
Andy: Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
Kelly: You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Andy: I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
Kelly: I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
Andy: Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?
Kelly: Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Andy: Well, I...
Kelly: Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
Andy: Count to twen - count to twenty.
Kelly: No. I'm gonna count to 3.
Andy: K
Kelly: 1... 2... 3
Andy: Agh! Son of a bitch!
Kelly: Andy, that was just the ice.
Andy: It was?
Kelly: Yeah. It was.
Lynn: Hey, Kevin.
Kevin: Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
Lynn: No.
Kevin: Oh...cause you smell like bacon.
Lynn: I didn't think I did. How's everything going?
Kevin: Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
Lynn: Oh.
Kevin: I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Lynn: We can still...
Kevin: Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Lynn: Yes.
Kevin: Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
Lynn: Yes, I had some bacon this morning. I just didn't think it was anyone's business.
Kevin: I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
Kevin: Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
Oscar: Just go down, Kevin.
Michael: My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.
Stanley: How did I end up back in Crazytown?
Dwight: It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
Phyllis: I was all-county my junior and senior years.
Dwight: Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
Phyllis: The girls school?
Dwight: I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Dwight: [sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
Erin: [phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Jim: Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
Jim: [whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Pam: [whispering] I can do it.
Dwight: [whispering] What do you need from me?
Dwight: Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Michael: [mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
Dwight: [changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
Jim: [silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Michael: [wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny?
Pam: You had to be there.
Michael: Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Michael: See you later!
Dwight: Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
Jim: [at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Pam: Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Pam: Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
Jim: Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
Pam: Tell them what happened last year.
Jim: I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Pam: No, no, that guy who hit on me.
Jim: Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
Pam: Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
Jim: Well...
Dwight: I'm gonna say 30.
Rolph: Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.
Dwight: Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Rolph: Woah. Homemade?
Dwight: Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
Dwight: Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Kevin: Michael, isn't that Holly?
Michael: We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Holly: Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
Michael: Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
Holly: All right.
Michael: All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
Holly: Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Michael: A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
AJ: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Holly: Lemonade sounds great.
Michael: Okay.
AJ: I'd love an iced tea, actually.
Michael: You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
Michael: I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
Charles: Jim. Pam.
Jim: Hey, how are you?
Pam: Hey Charles.
Charles: Nice day, huh?
Jim: Yeah.
Charles: Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
Jim: I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Pam: Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Jim: No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Dwight: Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Jim: Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Dwight: Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Andy: Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
Dwight: Why? I don't understand.
Andy: If-
Dwight: Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Andy: Uh... [laughs sheepishly]
Dwight: I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Andy: That's...
Dwight: Sly dog.
Andy: ... not what I meant.
Dwight: Come on, folks!
Michael: What is up with you two, Holly?
Holly: Um, not much.
AJ: We're designing a house.
Michael: Cool. For who?
AJ: For us.
Michael: Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
Holly: I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
AJ: I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
Michael: All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
Holly: Okay, yeah.
AJ: You guys are really gonna do this?
Michael: You bet your fat ass we are.
Michael: Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Holly: Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Michael: That's right.
Holly: [in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
Michael: Newspapers for sale!
Andy: [playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
Man: These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.
Andy: Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
Erin: Thanks.
Kevin: [playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
Dwight: Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Andy: Are you blind?!
Dwight: I could've gotten that, idiot!
Andy: Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
Dwight: It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Phyllis: We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Dwight: [grunts in frustration]
Dwight: [playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
Woman: So what?
Dwight: Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Pam: Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
Pam: Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
Pam: [serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Jim: Nice job, Beesly.
Dwight: Yes! We advance to the next round!
Phyllis: Oh, Lord in heaven.
Stanley: [to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Michael: I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
Holly: Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Michael: [watching her eat] What?
Holly: Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Michael: Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
Holly: Crystal cool.
Dwight: [playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!
Andy: Bump! I bumped it!
Kevin: Set!
Dwight: Don't set it to yourself!
Kevin: [Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
Phyllis: Ow, my ankle!
Dwight: What happened?
Phyllis: I... twisted it.
Dwight: You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
Angela: I can play.
Rolph: Is there a... Meredith here?
Meredith: Yeah! Man in!
Angela: Rolph, did you not hear me?
Rolph: I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go!
Michael: We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Holly: [gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
Michael: Oh!
Holly: We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Michael: Could we get a Delorean?
Holly: Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Michael: Oh! [to the theme of 'Jaws'] Dun-der. Dun-der...
Holly: Dun-der. Dun-der...
Michael: Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh]
Holly: Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Michael: No. No.
Holly: Oh.
Michael: We're circling it.
Holly: Hmm...
David: [playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Charles: Yes we are!
Rolph: You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!
Dwight: Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
Rolph: It's true!
Toby: Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Kendall: Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious.
Toby: Really, really funny.
Kendall: Really funny.
Dwight: Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
Oscar: Settle down gentlemen.
Pam: Good game!
David: Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Michael: [shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it's a sketch now.
David: Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
Michael: And now, presenting...
Both: SlumDunder Mifflinaire! [laughter]
Michael: [imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]
Holly: Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
Michael: Yes, I am.
Holly: For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Michael: Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
Holly: That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
Michael: [screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Holly: [now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Michael: Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
Holly: I'm Robert Dunder.
Michael: I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
Holly: Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Michael: Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
Holly: That is correct!
Michael: Yes!
Stanley: I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
Holly: The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Michael: I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
Holly: That is correct!
Man from Buffalo: [over crowd of murmurs] What is he talking about?
Holly: [pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
Michael: David Wallace told me!!
Woman from Buffalo: David, is this true?
David: Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
Man from Buffalo: Are we losing our jobs or not, David?
Holly: They didn't know?
Michael: [whispers] I guess not.
David: I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
Woman from Buffalo: And?
David: We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
Man from Buffalo: [over shouts of protest] You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it. [Michael and Holly bow]
David: How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Michael: Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
David: What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
Michael: Thank you.
David: Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Michael: Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
Meredith: Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
Dwight: Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
Pam: How do you figure?
Dwight: Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
Oscar: Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
Pam: Let's do this.
Andy: [playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
Charles: Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
Kevin: It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
Angela: Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Rolph: Here's an accounting question for you: what does one fiance plus one lover equal? Answer: one whore.
Dwight: Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
Rolph: What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-
Dwight: Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
Rolph: No way! You don't mean that!
Dwight: Rolph, leave it alone!
Erin: [hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
Pam: [running for the ball] I got it!
Dwight: Pam!
Pam: [falls] Oof!
Jim: You all right?
Pam: Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.
Jim: You sure?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Hey, easy, easy...
Charles: Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Pam: No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Charles: I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
David: Yeah.
Jim: All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Charles: Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
Jim: No, uh-
Pam: Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
Charles: Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
Dwight: [whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
Charles: I guess that's it for you, Jim.
Jim: All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
Pam: We'll be back!
Dwight: Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Michael: Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
Holly: Hindsight.
Michael: Should've had hindsight.
Holly: How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Michael: I think it went well. I think it was good.
Holly: There weren't any laughs.
Michael: No, it was a tough audience.
Holly: Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Michael: Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Holly: Well, I'm glad we did it.
Michael: Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Holly: I can't wait.
Jim: [on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Nurse: To be safe, we should do an x-ray.
Pam: How long will that take?
Nurse: Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant...
Pam: I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
Nurse: Oh good, because my next question was 'do you have a game to get back to.'
Holly: What'd you think?
AJ: I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but...
Michael: Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Holly: [laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
Michael: Good to see you. [they hug] AJ.
AJ: Michael. [they shake hands]
Michael: I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
David: Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Charles: Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
Dwight: Okay. Fine.
Charles: All right! Come on.
Dwight: Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Andy: Dwight.
Dwight: No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
David: Dwight.
Dwight: Seven? Can I finish please?
David: Okay.
Dwight: Eight?
Jim: [on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Toby: This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
Michael: Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]
Michael: Pfffffttt.
Toby: Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
Michael: You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
Toby: Please sit down.
Michael: You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
Everyone: YEAH! [laughter]
Michael: Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
Everyone: No. No!
Jim: That's... not okay.
Michael: Okay, alright.
Dwight: You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Michael: I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Dwight: No, hmmm... that's still...
Everyone: Mm-mm.
Michael: Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
Creed: Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
Oscar: All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Ryan: Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Michael: I don't know.
Stanley: How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Jim: Stanley, please, this is serious!
Angela: Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
Michael: Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
Dwight: Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
Toby: I don't wanna do this.
Michael: [shouting] Toby, just do it! God!
Dwight: Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Dwight: Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
Everyone: Yeah, that works. That works!
Michael: Good work. [clapping]
Pam: What flavors did you get? [yawns]
Erin: It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Pam: [reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
Erin: Do you want me to go back to the store?
Pam: No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
Erin: This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Pam: Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
Erin: After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
Pam: [yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
Erin: That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
Erin: We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Pam: And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
Erin: He's coming.
Pam: Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
Toby: [walks in] Hey everyone.
Pam: No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
Dwight: Leave, get outta here.
Pam: Leave!
Dwight: Right now!
Pam: Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
Michael: [walks in] Morning everyone.
Everyone: Hey! [applauses] Hey, hey!
Erin: Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]
Michael: Hello!
Dwight: Michael, nice tie or something.
Michael: Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]
Kevin: That's hilarious.
Pam: That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Michael: Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Kevin: Boi-oi-oi-ing
Michael: Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
Lawyer: I don't follow this exactly. Uh, 'The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have...'
Dwight and Angela: Joint custody
Lawyer: Are we talking about your grandchildren?
Angela: No.
Dwight: No.
Angela: Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Dwight: Alleged contract.
Angela: Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Dwight: Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Dwight: So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
Angela: I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Dwight: How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
Angela: Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Dwight: Eughh. [looks disgusted]
Andy: No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
Pam: Could he still be seeing her?
Phyllis: I don't think he'd do that.
Jim: So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Andy: Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
Jim: Exactly. It happened in Big.
Michael: No, I gotta go. Text me later.
Jim: I'm really too tired to do this.
Pam: Me too!
Jim: Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Pam: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey.
Pam: We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
Jim: We can order in from Hooters.
Michael: Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
Pam: We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Jim: Billy Joel Rock Band.
Michael: That... exists?
Pam: Yes.
Michael: Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
Pam: [shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Michael: Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Phyllis: Oh Michael.
Michael: Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
Michael: I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
Meredith: That is something I would never do.
Michael: Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
Meredith: Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Meredith: I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Michael: People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
Kelly: Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Ryan: Okay.
Michael: I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
Andy: How does he feel about it?
Michael: He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
Jim: Now you're just being hurtful.
Michael: I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
Phyllis: Hey!
Michael: On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
Andy: Did Donna tell you that?
Michael: Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
Andy: So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
Michael: You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Andy: My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
Andy: So... here's the thing about infidelity.
Michael: Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
Andy: How does that work?
Michael: Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
Andy: In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
Michael: I am Beyonce always.
Andy: Not this time.
Michael: Yes, I am.
Andy: This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Michael: I would love that.
Andy: Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
Michael: I have work to do.
Andy: Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
Michael: Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
Andy: [humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
Michael: All right, Andy, please.
Andy: Baseball!
Michael: Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
Andy: Where?
Michael: Right there. The coach!
Andy: Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Michael: Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
Andy: [announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
Michael: All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
Andy: Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
Gabe: [ahem][Pam snores] Guys?
Jim: Pam.
Pam: Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
Gabe: Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
Pam: You were supposed to be the Lookout.
Jim: Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Gabe: I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
Jim: Sorry about that.
Pam: So embarrassing.
Gabe: Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
Jim: Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
Pam: We will be well-rested tomorrow.
Gabe: Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
Jim: Excellent. Go for it.
Gabe: I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
Jim: Right? So, uh, let's uh...
Lawyer: Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.
Angela: Same page. Go to the next one.
Dwight: Same page. Just keep moving.
Lawyer: Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--
Dwight: Which we can't know.
Lawyer: This is essentially...
Dwight: Unless we're unplugged.
Lawyer: Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
Dwight: And wake up in the future.
Lawyer: Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
Dwight: What?
Lawyer: Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.
Angela: What?
Lawyer: So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.
Dwight: What?
Dwight: I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
Andy: Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
Michael: You have no idea what you're talking about.
Andy: I know it's like cricket.
Michael: You don't. No, no.
Andy: And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
Michael: You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'
Andy: Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Michael: Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
Andy: You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
Michael: I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
Dwight: $30,000? There's gotta be another way.
Angela: He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Dwight: Look, I will not pay.
Angela: Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
Dwight: Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
Lawyer: Look, I don't think that's actually legal.
Dwight: Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]
Dwight: Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
Dwight: But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
Angela: Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
Dwight: Fine. Five times. [signs contract]
Lawyer: Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.
Angela: I want eye contact.
Dwight: No.
Angela: Yes.
Dwight: Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Angela: I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
Andy: Great game, coach.
Michael: Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
Andy: You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
Shane: Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys.
Andy: Ha. The other guys can go die.
Michael: [whispers] Okay.
Andy: Baseball! Go talk to him.
Michael: No. God. You go talk to him.
Shane: Let's go.
Andy: Shane. Great game man!
Shane: Do I know you?
Andy: No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
Shane: Are you somebody's... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kenny's dads?
Andy: Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles]
Shane: Okay.
Andy: But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
Shane: Okay. Let's go!
Andy: Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Shane: Whoa!
Andy: I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
Shane: Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to... focus here on the game.
Andy: I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
Shane: Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this.
Andy: Of course.
Shane: All right.
Andy: But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
Michael: No, no, no.
Andy: Come on, get over here.
Michael: I'm good. Oh, my God.
Andy: Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
Michael: Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
Shane: It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going.
Michael: Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
Michael: Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
Erin: Thanks, Michael.
Michael: Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
Oscar: Why would you throw something wet at me?
Michael: You love it. There ya go.
Jim: Now, were those for the team?
Michael: Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
Jim: Ah.
Pam: I don't think those were yours to take.
Michael: Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
Andy: I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
Pam: Did you talk to him?
Michael: I did.
Pam: You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
Kevin: Wow. That is crazy.
Phyllis: Was there a fistfight?
Michael: No. We just talked. He's very nice.
Phyllis: And it didn't change your mind.
Michael: It did not.
Phyllis: Michael, that's awful.
Michael: Isn't it?
Phyllis: Yes.
Michael: I'm awful, aren't I?
Kevin: Yeah. That's pretty bad.
Michael: I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
Oscar: How can you live with yourself?
Michael: I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
Kevin: That is a dangerous game, friendo.
Kelly: Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Ryan: I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
Kelly: Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
Ryan: All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
Kelly: I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
Ryan: I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
Kelly: That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
Michael: I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
Ryan: Good for you, man. Good for you.
Ryan: He takes what he wants.
Ryan: You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
Erin: What about Kelly?
Ryan: You read my mind.
Erin: [quietly] Is this a joke?
Ryan: Yep.
Ryan: It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
Michael: You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
Dwight: [pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
Creed: [Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Michael: Yeah, I noticed that.
Creed: Are you gonna add any more?
Michael: Nope.
Creed: He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!
Michael: I have got big balls.
Pam: I don't think I'm gonna make it.
Jim: [yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Pam: [shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Jim: Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
Pam: Well, it does and it doesn't.
Darryl: Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
Jim: A place?
Darryl: A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Pam: You sleep in the warehouse?
Darryl: Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Jim: Okay.
Darryl: Pam.
Pam: Okay.
Phyllis: For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Michael: Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
Kevin: Why not your condo?
Michael: Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
Stanley: Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
Michael: Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Andy: Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
Michael: Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes]
Dwight: I could have stopped him.
Dwight: Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
Angela: No.
Dwight: God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
Angela: What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Dwight: Never mind. Just never mind.
Angela: Well, it better work.
Dwight: Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
Michael: [driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
Reporter: Michael Scott?
Michael: Yes?
Reporter: Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
Michael: [sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
Reporter: I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
Michael: Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
Michael: [on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.
Todd Packer: [high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  [normal voice] It's Packer!
Michael: OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Michael: Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.
Michael: Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
Oscar: What's number one?
Michael: Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
Jim: So instead of working, you want...
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
Angela: Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Phyllis: Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
Michael: Please.
Dwight: Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Michael: Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.
Jo: Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Michael: Jo! We were not expecting you!
Jo: Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here.
Kevin: No.
Jo: Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go.
Kevin: Jo, I think that I know what happened.
Jo: I'm not sure you do, teddy bear.
Kevin: Well, now I think I might not.
Jo: Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.
Michael: Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
Jo: Can you now?
Michael: Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
Phyllis: [quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
Andy: If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
Andy: So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
Jo: [as Gabe hands out forms to everyone] It's a little form, says 'I did not do it.'
Michael: There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
Jo: All that's just birthday information, Michael.
Michael: Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
Jo: Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say?
Michael: Okay.
Jo: When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one question: What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, 'Come down on him with that swift hammer of justice!', innocent. A clear conscience don't need no mercy. But if they said 'Officer Bessie, well they may have had a reason, blah blah blah blah', well nine times out of ten, that's the anus they'd check.
Jo: So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?
Michael: We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
Jo: Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay.
Michael: Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
Jo: Well, I guess we're all right, Michael.
Michael: I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
Jo: Yeah.
Michael: Okay.
Nick: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: Hey, IT guy.
Nick: Mind if I get in there for a second?
Dwight: Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
Nick: Just one... [Dwight pushes Nick's neck to the desk and pushes his arm up] Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?
Dwight: Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
Oscar: The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
Dwight: You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Kevin: Wait, are they searching all our computers?
Nick: Yeah. [Kevin runs to his desk] I already got to yours, Kevin. [Kevin runs back]
Kevin: No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Angela: Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Michael: Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
Phyllis: Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Jo: Okay Dwight.
Dwight: Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
Jo: Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
Dwight: Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Jo: Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?
Dwight: Are you referring to alchemy?
Jo: I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy.
Dwight: I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
Jo: Well, buy property. That's my advice.
Michael: Is there something that you would like to say to me?
Andy: Uh...
Michael: About talking to the press?
Andy: I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
Michael: Mmhmm.
Andy: Okay? I, I... didn't do it.
Michael: I don't believe you.
Andy: I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
Michael: That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
Andy: I don't care, that's how much I swear!
Michael: Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
Andy: I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Michael: Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
Darryl: Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
Michael: Oh, no, no, no...
Darryl: I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Michael: Oh my god. Was she cute?
Darryl: No.
Michael: Oh, god, Darryl!
Michael: I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.
Jo: Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.
Toby: Well, that's...
Jo: And we didn't find anything on your computer.
Toby: Good.
Jo: Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby]
Toby: Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
Jo: I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?
Toby: Oh, uh, I don't know, uh...
Jo: The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.
Toby: Oh... yes.
Toby: Write your own damn novel.
Pam: It was me.
Jim: What was you? You were the leak?
Pam: Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
Jim: Uh-huh.
Pam: She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
Jim: Why'd you do that?
Pam: Her husband's a reporter.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
Jim: Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
Pam: I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
Jim: This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Michael: You leaked it?
Pam: I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
Michael: I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
Pam: That fast?
Michael: Oh.
Michael: Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
Pam: [Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Michael: So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
Pam: Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
Pam: [in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
Darryl: All right, this is just messed up.
Michael: No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
Darryl: All right.
Michael: What do we got?
Pam: Um...
Kelly: [opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
Pam: We're not going for yogurt.
Michael: It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
Kelly: Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Michael: Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
Kelly: Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
Ryan: Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Erin: [on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Ryan: Thank you, Erin. Woof!
Michael: Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
Pam: Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
Michael: No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
Kelly: That idea sucks.
Pam: I don't think that's a good idea.
Michael: Just don't say no.
Darryl: Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Kelly: Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Michael: That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
Pam: Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
Michael: Okay. You can count on me.
Dwight: [sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
Toby: I'm hungry.
Dwight: Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
Realtor: [on phone] The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.
Dwight: Basement office? You mean like a lair?
Michael: Hey Jo.
Jo: Michael.
Michael: I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
Jo: Michael Scott... what do you know?
Michael: What?
Michael: It doesn't matter what I know.
Jo: If it doesn't matter, then tell me.
Michael: Why?
Jo: Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
Michael: Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]
Jo: Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak. [Jo's dog barks] Come with me.
Michael: What?
Gabe: [as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
Michael: Are you going to kill me?
Jo: Hahahahahaha.
Realtor: [on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.
Dwight: Okay.
Realtor: What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works?
Dwight: Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Realtor: But... [Dwight closes phone]
Michael: [on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
Creed: I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
Gabe: All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.
Stanley: It wasn't me.
Gabe: What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
Andy: What? Based on what?
Gabe: Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
Dwight: All right. Sounds good.
Jim: Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Andy: Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
Jim: Really?
Jo: Michael.
Michael: I have rights.
Jo: Let's just talk.
Michael: I am not going to tell you anything.
Jo: Honey, you don't seem like your normal self.
Michael: Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
Jo: Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Michael: Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
Jo: Oh, I hate that.
Michael: And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
Jo: Who's Holly?
Michael: Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
Kevin: Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
Dwight: Oh, just...
David Wallace: I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
Andy: Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
Jim: I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Pam: Yes, it's totally obvious.
Creed: I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
Nick: Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.
Gabe: Uh, not now.
Nick: Oh yeah, it's just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would...
Stanley: [quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
Phyllis: I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
Nick: My name is Nick.
Angela: Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
Nick: Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me.
Jim: Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
Nick: You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?
Jim: No... sport.
Nick: You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?
Dwight: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
Nick: Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what? [gestures to Ryan] You're not a photographer. [gestures to Kelly] And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you. [points to Andy] This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out. [gives the finger]
Andy: You're going to believe that guy?
Jo: When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me.
Michael: Hmm, hmm.
Jo: I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.
Michael: You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
Jo: Oh honey, surely you don't want that.
Michael: I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
Dwight: I'm about to buy this building, you know.
Hank: You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
Dwight: Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
Andy: Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
Phyllis: [points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
Andy: Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
Kevin: [offscreen] No, it does not!
Andy: Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
Angela: It does!
Erin: Andy?
Andy: Hey.
Erin: I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Andy: Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
Erin: Yeah.
Michael: [to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
Jo: Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.
Michael: That was fun.
Jo: I hope your rough patch ends soon.
Michael: Thanks. Today helped.
Jo: Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.
Michael: Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
Jo: Let me see what I can do.
Pam: We could get Deangelo flowers.
Dwight: No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Phyllis: That's true.
Jim: All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Dwight: Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
Jim: Nope. Baskets have it.
Jim: So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
Jim: [on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Dwight: [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Jim: Wait...
Pam: What have you done?
Dwight [on phone]: Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.
Mose [on phone]: Aaaaahhhhh!
Pam: Can't stay there all day.
Jim: I'm coming.
Pam: Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Jim: You'd slow me down.
Jim: Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Pam: Stop stalling! Come on.
All: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...
All but Oscar: ...under God...
All: ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group]
Angela: Amen.
Dwight: Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Erin: Ooh, about what?
Dwight: That's on a need-to-know basis.
Erin: I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Dwight: [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Jim: Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Dwight: Define foment.
Jim: You define foment.
Dwight: [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Dwight: [surprising Kelly] Aha!
Kelly: Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Dwight: Gotcha! Why are you late?
Kelly: It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Dwight: All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
Andy: In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Erin: Oh! Darryl's funny.
Andy: I know, right?
Gabe: Hey, Andy?
Andy: Yeah?
Gabe: Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Andy: Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Gabe: Are you still in love with Erin?
Andy: What?
Gabe: Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Andy: No, this is horrifying.
Gabe: No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Andy: We're just friends, okay?
Gabe: Do you promise that?
Andy: Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Gabe: No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
Dwight: [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Jim: Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Dwight: You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Jim: Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Dwight: Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
Jim: And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Kevin: [inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
Stanley: [refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
Andy: Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
Dwight: I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Kevin: [looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Creed: He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Pam: You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Creed: No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
Phyllis: He means the ice pack.
Erin: [on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Gabe: I'm sorry. This can't wait.
Erin: He's just gonna call back.
Gabe: Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
Erin: [quietly] What?
Gabe: Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Erin: Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Gabe: Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
Erin: I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Jim: Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Dwight: Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
Jim: And the desk.
Dwight: The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Jim: I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Dwight: Don't make me fire you.
Jim: You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Dwight: Don't make me pre-fire you.
Jim: You wouldn't dare.
Dwight: Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
Jim: [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Dwight: What?
Jim: If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Dwight: How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan: I'm good.
Dwight: Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Jordan: Why are you telling me this?
Dwight: Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
Dwight: [walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
Pam: Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
Dwight: The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Andy: Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
Dwight: The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
Pam: Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight: Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Angela: Thank you.
Phyllis: You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Dwight: Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Kevin: You could put a banana in it.
Dwight: Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Kevin: In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Pam: Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
Dwight: Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Erin: Andy!
Andy: Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
Oscar: My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Andy: [trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
Meredith: Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Toby: Hey, what happened?
Kelly: Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Dwight: No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
Andy: [scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
Oscar: I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Angela: Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Oscar: [buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Gabe: I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Dwight: Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Andy: I think I should go the hospital.
Erin: I'll go with you.
Gabe: No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Darryl: I'll take him.
Andy: Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
Darryl: What's wrong with you?
Andy: It's my ear.
Darryl: Yeah.
Andy: Okay, sorry.
Toby: [excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
Gabe: I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Dwight: Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Dwight: [enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
Stanley: We all saw you do it.
Dwight: Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Erin: Navy blue. Little red anchors.
Dwight: I have no way of knowing if that's true.
Toby: I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Dwight: Okay, really?
Toby: Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
Ryan: I felt terrorized.
Dwight: Come on.
Toby: Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Dwight: I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Ryan: Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Dwight: Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Andy: Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
Dwight: There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Andy: Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Dwight: Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Andy: Yeah.
Phyllis: How's your hearing?
Andy: Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
Darryl: I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Kelly: Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Dwight: American Idol? What? No.
Kelly: Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Dwight: No.
Kelly: [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Dwight: Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
Phyllis: Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
Angela: Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Kevin: Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Dwight: I put everything back in the vending machine.
Kevin: Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
Pam: You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Dwight: Okay.
Jim: Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Dwight: Thank God.
Jim: Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Dwight: What's jazz hands?
Jim: [quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Dwight: Fine.
Dwight: [leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Kevin: [after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
Jo: Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.
Dwight: Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Jo: Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Jim: Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Jo: Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]
Dwight: [does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
Andy: We have to clean this up now!
Erin: She had so much -
Gabe: Hey, guys.
Erin: Hey.
Gabe: Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Andy: No! [Erin and Andy laugh]
Gabe: Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
Andy: Uh...
Gabe: I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Andy: Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Gabe: No, I was not.
Andy: And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
Dwight: Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Kevin: Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
Dwight: No, Kevin, come on.
Kevin: My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
Dwight: Kevin, not now.
Kevin: Hey, Jo!
Dwight: Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Kevin: No, under the jacket.
Dwight: You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
Kevin: I don't feel anything.
Dwight: Oh, it's so wet.
Kevin: Push harder, Dwight.
Dwight: I can't. I can't push harder!
Kevin: Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Dwight: Okay, how's that?
Kevin: Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Dwight: I'm kneading it!
Kevin: Don't eat it.
Jo: Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?
Dwight: Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Jo: What?!
Dwight: I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Jo: Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
Dwight: It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Jo: Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
Dwight: I take full responsibility.
Jo: Who else would be responsible?
Dwight: Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Pam: You shot a gun off -
Dwight: Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Jo: Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
Dwight: Got it.
Jo: I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.
Dwight: [on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Jo: No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.
Jo: You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
Gabe: Yep.
Jim: Yep.
Jo: Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?
Toby: Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Jo: Who is it?
Jim: Hey, Dwight. What's up?
Dwight: Shut up.
Jim: Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
Angela: [giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Kevin: Another one?
Darryl and Angela: Yes!
Angela: Seven, two...
Oscar: Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Angela: Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
Darryl: Nine first.
Angela: Nine, eight, five...
Kevin: Thank you.
Angela: Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
Kevin: Nice.
Angela: Two, one...
Kevin: Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
Angela: God!
Creed: [drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
Creed: Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Creed: [to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
Creed: [running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Jim: He never called a meeting.
Creed: [pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
Pam: What are we doing?
Creed: We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
Kevin: Um... Business!
Creed: I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
Pam: We need a new manager.
Jim: [conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Fred Henry: Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
Jim: Really?
Fred: Yeah.
Jim: [waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Fred: Nice try.
Toby: I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?
Fred: Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan.
Gabe: Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
Fred: [speaking faster] Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?
Gabe: How would we know that, if you don't...
Jim: You could just be saying it to get the job.
Fred: I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?
Jim: How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Fred: Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
Jim: Okay.
Fred: Color-code sent documents, TM.
Jim: Did you just trademark that...
Toby: [confused] W-What?
Fred: That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.
Jim: We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Stanley: [in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
Darryl: Good morning.
Phyllis: [also to Darryl] Good morning.
Darryl: Good morning.
Phyllis: Did you have a nice drive in?
Darryl: I did.
Darryl: I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
Andy: [puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
Erin: [commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Andy: The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
Erin: Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Andy: Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
Erin: You in the boss's chair!
Andy: EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
Andy: In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
Erin: [checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Phyllis: Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
Phyllis: It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Erin: So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Phyllis: But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Erin: Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Phyllis: Mm.
Erin: But why not find out.
Phyllis: Yeah.
Pam: [to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
Dwight: They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Pam: Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Dwight: Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Warren Buffett: Can you do any better on salary?
Jim: Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Warren: What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.
Jim: Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Warren: How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?
Angela: [on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Kevin: The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
Toby: How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Robert California: You don't work in sales, do you.
Toby: Uh... Human Resources.
Robert: You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.
Toby: Yes.
Gabe: Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Robert: Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
Gabe: No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
Jim: Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Robert: Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
Jim: Yes.
Robert: That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
Jim: Yes.
Robert: [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]
Jim: [Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Andy: [Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
Darryl: [pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
Darryl: Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Jim: [Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Darryl: So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Gabe: Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Darryl: Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
Toby: So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
Darryl: I thought that was your job.
Toby: Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
Jim: Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Darryl: I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
Darryl: [noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
Jim: [ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Darryl: I... I just thought you knew me.
Jim: Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Darryl: Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
Merv Bronte: [at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?
Robert: Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
Merv: What do you mean?
Robert: That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.
Merv: Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job. [gets on elevator]
Merv: [in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here.
Dwight: What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
Robert: I just did.
Dwight: You can't.
Robert: It's done.
Dwight: No, it's not.
Robert: I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says:  You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]
Dwight: Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Robert: I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]
Dwight: [standing up] Get out.
Dwight: I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Merv: You guys pay for relocation, though, right?
Toby: Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Merv: Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
Jim: Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Merv: [pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich]
Jim: Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Merv: I'm having a bad time. [chuckles]
Toby: I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
Merv: [continues to chew, slower and slower, appears confused] Wait.
Merv: Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.
Angela: [limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
Pam: [looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Kelly: Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Meredith: [looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
Angela: It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Meredith: Tell us the freaking story!
Kevin: Yeah! Tell us a story.
Angela: Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
Pam: [laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Angela: Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Pam: That's not accurate.
Angela: Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Oscar: Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Jim: Andy? You all set?
Andy: Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
Phyllis: Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Andy: [grunts] Augh.
Erin: I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Jim: So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Andy: For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
Gabe: Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Andy: I wasn't acc-, accusing...
Gabe: Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
Andy: Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
Toby: I didn't think you were.
Gabe: I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
Gabe: How many windows are there in New York City?
Andy: What?
Gabe: Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Andy: Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Gabe: No... How far away is the Sun?
Andy: [happily] Uh, 93 million miles.
Jim: [to Gabe] Is it?
Andy: Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
Gabe: Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
Andy: [alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
Darryl: [on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
Creed: [on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
Pam: How is this on me?
Pam: Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Creed: [takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
Pam: They're the same picture.
Kelly: Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Jim: Your department's just you, right?
Kelly: Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Gabe: Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
Kelly: What was that?
Gabe: We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Kelly: [getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Gabe: What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
Kelly: I don't have any, assh***.
Dwight: [comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Dwight: [walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Jim: Good!
Dwight: Good. They good?
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
Jim: Peepa.
Dwight: Peepa, how is she?
Jim: Great.
Dwight: Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Jim: No.
Dwight: Now, listen,...
Jim: You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Dwight: Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
Jim: [pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
Dwight: I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
Jim: Yikes.
Dwight: Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Jim: Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Dwight: Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]
Jim: Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Dwight: Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
Jim: Thank you.
Dwight: Okay. [looks ashamed]
Oscar: Pam... I think Robert is gay.
Pam: The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
Oscar: [whispers] So!?
Pam: And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Oscar: I have a very strong suspicion.
Pam: Did you see him at a bathhouse?
Oscar: What bathhouse?
Pam: The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Oscar: [confused, whispers] What?
Pam: Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
Oscar: My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Pam: You're in the gay mafia.
Oscar: You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
Ryan: You guys, um, talking Senator?
Pam: No.
Oscar: No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Ryan: Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
Ryan: Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
David Brent: [on video resume on a laptop] Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. [points at self] When do I start? Yeah. [Jim looks uninterested in this candidate]
Phyllis: Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Erin: [trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
Phyllis: Bestiality. Yeah.
Erin: Well, that's not my personality.
Phyllis: If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
Erin: Yes?
Phyllis: I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Erin: I do really want him.
Darryl: So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Jim: Great.
Darryl: Hope it's all right.
Jim: I'm sure it's fine.
Darryl: The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Jim: Howard Cline?
Darryl: Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
Jim: [checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Darryl: Yes. How did he do?
Jim: He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Darryl: Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Jim: Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
Nellie Bertram: First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.
Toby: But there aren't...
Nellie: Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Gabe: A little un-specific.
Nellie: Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
Jim: That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Nellie: Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Gabe: How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
Nellie: Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
Gabe: Okay.
Nellie: By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Jim: I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Nellie: Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
Jim: That's very...
Nellie: You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Gabe: Okay, that's not gonna be...
Nellie: Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Oscar: Is there a front runner?
Jim: You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Oscar: Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Jim: No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Oscar: Well...
Stanley: The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Ryan: [in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Stanley: My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
Jim: Uh--
Meredith: You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Jim: Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Oscar: Are you? [leaves]
Ryan: Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
Jo: [walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe]
Gabe: All right.
Jo: Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Jim: No, was it good?
Jo: Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. [picks up resume from Jim's desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?
Darryl: Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Jo: Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?
Darryl: Paper material, ma'am.
Jo: Paper material?
Darryl: [softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Dwight: [clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Jo: Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Dwight: Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
Jo: I'll interview you right now.
Dwight: Okay.
Jo: Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
Dwight: It's complicated.
Jo: Yeah, but see... it's not.
Phyllis: I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Pam: I'm a woman. I would want to know.
Meredith: Yeah, you gotta know.
Kevin: Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
Oscar: You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Phyllis: You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
Pam: She does seem happy.
Oscar: You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Kevin: We don't tell her.
Pam: Okay.
Kelly: Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Jo: Okay.
Kelly: Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Jo: Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo's phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her 'Dwight's ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,'] Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!
Creed: [to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
Jordan: Who is our biggest client?
Pam: Uh, just put him through to me.
Jordan: [laughs] Okay.
Pam: Hello! This is... the client.
Creed: It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Pam: Yes.
Creed: Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
Pam: Great.
Creed: All right, thank you, bye-bye.
Pam: Thank you, bye-bye.
Erin: [knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Jo: Huh?
Erin: [motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Jo: No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?
Gabe: I have no idea.
Jim: [seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight: [mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight: [again] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: What is it?
Dwight: [in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
Jo: I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn't here in sixty seconds...
Dwight: Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Jim: [looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Dwight: [whispers] Yeah.
Jim: [looks astonished] Ohhhh!
Gabe: Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Jo: Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
Dwight: I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Jo: All that for this job.
Dwight: Yes.
Jo: That's f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.
Jim: This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Jo: Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?
Jim: Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Jo: Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?
Gabe: How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
Jo: And that's your unbiased opinion.
Gabe: Yes, it is.
Jo: So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Gabe: Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
Jo: Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
Gabe: That sounds like a promotion!
Jo: It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
Jim: Um... why Kelly?
Jo: Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
Jim: Okay.
Jo: How'd my girl Nellie do?
Jim: Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
Jo: She didn't mention it?
Jim: No.
Jo: Integrity move. I like it.
Jim: You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Jo: Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
Erin: [hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Oscar: Erin, what are you doing?
Erin: I've been turned into a puppet!
Oscar: Okay. [walks away]
Kevin: [giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
Erin: I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Kevin: [giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
Erin: And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Kevin: It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Erin: [as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
Dwight: Silence?
Erin: A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Andy: Hey, Erin.
Erin: [gets up] Oh.
Andy: Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
Erin: [shrugs] I've done it all my life.
Andy: Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
Andy: Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
Angela: [loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Stanley: I'll get over it.
Angela: I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Pam: That was our dream wedding.
Angela: Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
Pam: [looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Angela: Hmm.
Jim: All right. Name.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute.
Jim: Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
Dwight: You have to interview me...
Jim: I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Dwight: I demand more questions!
Jim: [ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Dwight: Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
Jim: Yes.
Dwight: What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Jim: Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
Jim: Well, that was quick.
Kelly: [sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Jim: He's not a real candidate.
Kelly: I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Jim: You took the deal.
Kelly: Yeah, it was a great deal.
Jim: That's not okay.
Kelly: I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
Toby: Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
Jim: What is happening right now?
Phyllis: Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Jim: No, why would you think that?
Phyllis: He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Jim: Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Kelly: That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Jim: No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Dwight: Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
Jim: Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Andy: Tuna... You're completely sane.
Jim: Thank you.
Andy: Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Jim: Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Kevin: Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Jim: [while sighing] I suppose I am.
Kevin: Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Oscar: I don't think he meant, that--
Kevin: So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Oscar: Go ahead.
Kevin: What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Oscar: Can I say...?
Jim: Yes.
Oscar: I think it should be Darryl.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Oscar: Kelly's on your side.
Kelly: I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
Andy: Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Ryan: I want an outsider.
Jim: Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Ryan: No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Pam: A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
Ryan: No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Pam: No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Ryan: Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Ryan: I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Meredith: I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Jim: Hey! Hey! Hey!
Meredith: Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Andy: She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
Gabe: [walks in] Gotta catch a plane.
Pam: Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
Gabe: Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
Kelly: You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Gabe: Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
Kelly: I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Gabe: There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Kevin: Later, man.
All: [various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.
Ryan: Take care, man.
Dwight: We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
Andy: [stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
Erin: I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Phyllis: Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Phyllis: No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
Jim: What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Angela: Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Toby: No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
Kevin: Exactly.
Darryl: [enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
Jada: Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?
Darryl: [sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
Jada: I don't know if he'd be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he's a really great dad!
Darryl: Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Phyllis: It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Jim: What? No, no, it's not a vote.
Phyllis: Then what was this all about?
Jim: I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Kelly: I don't care. They can just vote.
Jim: No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Andy: Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
Nellie: This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
Darryl: Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Fred: No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of... [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration.
Merv: Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today.
Robert: [chuckles] I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.
Finger Lakes Guy: [geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.
Dwight: I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Creed: You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Pam: [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?
Creed: I think you two should meet.
Pam: Well, okay!
Creed: Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
Pam as fourth-biggest client: [in a comedic male voice] Hello!
Pam as ninth-biggest client: [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!
Pam as fourth-biggest client: Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]
Pam as ninth-biggest client: Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!
Pam as fourth-biggest client: Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!
Creed: It's Kismet!
Gabe: Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Dwight: Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don���t you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
Gabe: I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They���d flex them all night at the discotheque.
Dwight: Oh, I bet you think it���s all about core, huh?
Gabe: Yeah.
Dwight: Oh, please.
Gabe: Core���s critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ��� lengthen. Two ��� elongate.
Jim: Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who���s the strongest? Well, there���s only one way to solve that ��� flat curl contest.
Jim: All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Dwight: Feast on this, Lewis.
Gabe: I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Jim: Come on, Gabe, you can���t handle his hamstrings. You���re getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Gabe: Speed set. One. Two.
Jim: Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Dwight: Oh, thank you.
Jim: You���re welcome.
Gabe: Five. Six.
Jim: Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
All: Eight, nine, ten.
Gabe: We got it?
Dwight: Very funny Jim.
Gabe: Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Robert: Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
Jim: All right, easy there, grandpa.
Dwight: I don���t need your help.
Jim: Okay. You don���t need my help?
Dwight: Here, here��� Just���
Andy: Morning.
Erin: Hey.
Andy: Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot��� these.
Erin: Oh.
Andy: You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Erin: Andy, if you���re gonna hang out for a while, uh���
Andy: What���s this?
Erin: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Andy: Is this Robert���s attempt to embarrass me?
Erin: No, of course not. It���s just ��� I think it���s like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it���s like, where does it end? So just��� [puts visitors tag on Andy]
Andy: Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they���re rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it���s a little much? ���Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that���s what it feels like.
Jim: All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Dwight: Good, we have a deal?
Jim: Thanks Janet.
Dwight: Thanks so much Earl.
Jim: Wow, simultaneous sale.
Dwight: And they said it couldn���t be done. Boom!
Jim: Screw ���em.
Andy: Lot going on guys. What���s happening?
Jim: Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Andy: That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It���s like a festival of poo.
Jim: Hey, hey, come on, language.
Dwight: Yeah, and we���re not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Jim: In the fridge.
Dwight: No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Jim: Sorry, man, I can���t focus on zingers. There���s too many potential clients.
Stanley: You two better watch yourselves.
Phyllis: Yeah, the Syracuse branch can���t be happy you���re taking New York clients.
Robert: Shh��� shh��� [vomits in trash can]
Jim: Robert?
Oscar: Why did Binghamton close?
Robert: Can everyone just, please��� I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and ��� how should I say this ��� Columbian whites. What ��� what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
Kevin: The branch closed. Forever.
Robert: Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I���m not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
Nellie: I got your voicemail. From ��� from last night.
Robert: Wonderful.
Nellie: And the answer��� is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Robert: Pam, when���s the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn���t hold the memories in?
Pam: Oh, it was this summer ���
Robert: Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Pam: Um, I am a little busy.
Robert: Yes, ���course. Why don���t you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
Pam: Yeah, I can make you a list.
Robert: Let���s do it now. What���s number one?
Pam: Why don���t I help you now?
Robert: There we go.
Pam: Okay.
Harry: Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
Erin: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
Dwight: And you are���
Harry: Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.
Harry: What the hell���s all this?
Andy: Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
Harry: You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one���s that guy?
Jim: The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Dwight: Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ��� how do I put this ��� steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Jim: Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Dwight: [pointing at Toby] There he is. That���s Lloyd.
Toby: Me?
Creed: Yeah, you.
Harry: Where do you get off crossing state lines?
Toby: Now, we���re actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
Toby: I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn���t back down from anybody. And he calls people ���Kimosabe���.
Harry: They���re New York. We���re New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That���s the way it���s always been.
Jim: There���s actually not a rule that says that.
Dwight: That���s true.
Toby: That���s true. There���s no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Toby: No.
Dwight: Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could���ve choked so many people by now.
Harry: Stay out of my state. It���s in your best interest to stay out of my state.
Toby: I���ve seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Harry: Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.
Toby: Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
Jim: How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Harry: Robert���s here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don���t think we were doing that.
Dwight: Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim���s leg.
Robert: Where���s the Advil, Jim? I think I���ve hit my limit on the Tylenol ��� Oh.
Andy: [Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.
Robert: Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
Andy: Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Robert: Oh, for god ���
Harry: Robert California. What a surprise you���re here in Scranton.
Robert: Harry���
Harry: So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
Robert: How do you mean?
Andy: I forgot, a��� a pan, uh ���
Harry: No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
Robert: Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There���s no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems��� so poorly timed.
Dwight: Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Harry: Listen, Robert, I don���t have time. There���s a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions ���
Dwight: Don���t listen to him.
Harry: Used to be Binghamton���s ���
Dwight: Nope.
Harry: I want it, it���s mine.
Dwight: Prestige is ours. Okay, they���re responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Harry: We need you to make a decision.
Dwight: Make a decision.
Robert: I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said��� [Andy walks out]
Andy: Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
Robert: Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I���ll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
Harry: Is it just me or is our boss a freakin��� weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I���m gonna get some air.
Dwight: Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Jim: [Gets up and looks out Nellie���s office window] He���s running!
Dwight: Damn it!
Jim: Damn it.
Dwight: Wha ��� what is this supposed to be?
Jim: It���s a monkey.
Dwight: Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It���s got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Jim: Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Dwight: What?
Jim: Is that him?
Dwight: It���s him! Do something! Get out!
Jim: What? What am I gonna do? I don���t ���
Dwight: Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That���s it? Oh, that���s great. That���s like a five second delay.
Jim: Dwight!
Dwight: Come on, let���s go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Jim: Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Dwight: Yeah.
Jim: Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Dwight: Hit the nos.
Jim: Are you sure?
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Brace yourself. 3��� 2���
Dwight: Got it. Go.
Jim: 1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
Andy: Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
Receptionist: Oh, do you have an appointment?
Andy: No, I do not.
Receptionist: Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.
Andy: Seriously? ���Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Receptionist: He���s really not that busy.
Mr. Ramish: Is there someone here to see me?
Receptionist: Yes, this man.
Mr. Ramish: Come on in. [Andy walks in]
Pam: So���what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Nellie: Oh. Oh, I���ll tell you what he does.
Angela: : [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don���t worry, I won���t lay an egg.
Angela: : Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
Angela: : I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Gabe: Did someone say girl talk?
Gabe: Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Gabe: Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I���m pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
Nellie: Do you think I���d like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Gabe: Uh, I think you���re gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It���ll be upsetting if you don���t.
Andy: I���m a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Mr. Ramish: Why haven���t I heard of you? You got any references?
Andy: No. I���m a rogue.
Mr. Ramish: Uh-huh.
Andy: Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now��� [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Mr. Ramish: Every salesman I���ve ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Andy: Of course they have. Which is why I���m giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ��� anytime, night or day ��� you just stop on by.
Mr. Ramish: You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
Andy: Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe��� you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
Dwight: Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Dwight: [Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
Jim: You all right?
Dwight: Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
Jim: Ah! [Harry walks in]
Jim: [Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight: Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
Jim: What are you talking about?
Dwight: Just run! Take the stairs!
Jim: I don���t even know where the stairs are!
Dwight: I���ll stall him. Go!
Jim: God!
Harry: [Dwight jumping] What are you doing?
Dwight: I���m gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We���ll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
Jim: What?
Dwight: My pants fell down! I don���t have a belt!
Dwight: [walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Mr. Ramish: What���s going on?
Dwight: Well ���
Harry: Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse ���
Dwight: I was here first.
Mr. Ramish: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
Dwight: I already made an appointment��� with your secretary.
Mr. Ramish: Let me stop you all right here. I���ve already picked a new paper supplier.
Dwight: Wait, it���s not D.M Utica, is it?
Mr. Ramish: No, no, it���s not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It���s��� Big Red Paper Company.
Jim: Big Red Paper Company?
Mr. Ramish: Mm-hmm.
Andy: Yes, yes, yes!
Harry: Give me a cup of coffee.
Dwight: Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Jim: All right, guys. It didn���t work out for any of us, so��� we���re still on the same team. Let me get these.
Dwight: No. Let him get his own. It���s Syracuse money.
Harry: You know, your partner���s got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
Dwight: Jim couldn���t land me in a thousand years.
Jim: But you���re saying there���s a chance.
Dwight: Shut up.
Pam: [Walks into conference room] Hey.
Robert: Hmm.
Pam: I stole Nellie���s phone.
Robert: Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Pam: What do you want from me?
Robert: Now we get to the bottom of Nellie���s ���yes, yes, yes, yes, never.���
Phone: Hi, Nell, it���s mom. Do keep your chin up. It can���t be as bad as you described.
Robert: Oh yes it can.
Phone: This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
Robert: Shopaholic.
Pam: Sounds like it.
Robert: Yeah.
Phone: Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?
Robert: Ah.
Phone: This is Annie from second nests. I���m sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we���re gonna hold out for that.
Pam: Okay, that���s enough. [grabs phone]
Robert: Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Pam: No, no, no!
Robert: No, come on.
Pam: Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They���re all deleted.
Robert: Pam, Pam, you���ve completely bungled this!
Pam: Ah. Ahh. [walks out]
Pam: Hey.
Nellie: Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Pam: Um��� yes. Definitely. With your hair ���
Nellie: Oh!
Pam: Certainly. Um��� you dropped your cell phone.
Nellie: Oh, gosh.
Pam: Yep.
Nellie: Thank you. I���m��� so stupid.
Pam: No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
Nellie: Oh, god, Pam. Don���t get me started.
Pam: No, I will not.
Nellie: You���ve just got me started. Robert��� is��� a filthy beast. I mean, don���t you get the feeling, he���s just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Pam: Well ���
Nellie: I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Pam: But sometimes he talks about flesh��� and bacchanals.
Nellie: I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
Pam: No��� don���t. Just put it out of your mind.
Nellie: Pam, what is your address? I���m gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don���t ���
Nellie: Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Nellie: Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And��� I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Robert: [Erin opens door] Erin.
Erin: There���s a call for you on line one.
Robert: Who is it?
Erin: He says salvation. No last name.
Robert: Yeah, hello?
Andy: [in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don���t, and I will find another buyer.
Robert: You���re blackmailing me.
Andy: It���s just business.
Robert: Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You���re gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don���t even know my real name. I���m the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]
Andy: Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
David: [opens door] Andy Bernard.
Andy: You got a minute?
David: Um��� I���m in the middle of a piano lesson.
Andy: I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
David: Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now��� why would I want that? It���s worth half of what it was three years ago.
Andy: Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
David: Why don���t you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
Harry: So what would you do if you weren���t selling paper?
Jim: Oh, man, I���d have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Dwight: What?
Jim: Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Dwight: How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don���t even care about nationals.
Harry: Nothing?
Jim: I don���t know. I���ve always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Harry: I���d like to sell one big thing, you know? Like��� a plane. One sale, I���m out.
Jim: That sounds lovely.
Harry: Anyway, Robert���s gonna run this company into the ground, so��� We won���t be doing this in six months.
Oscar: [to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
Phyllis: What's he doing?
Dwight: He's searching out younger gays.
Phyllis: Oh.
Oscar: No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
Dwight: ...with you. [chuckles]
Oscar: No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
Kelly: Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Oscar: Do you not own a mirror?
Kelly: Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
Pam: I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
Kelly: I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
Oscar: Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Robert: No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
Oscar: It's not misleading.
Robert: -pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as 'normal.' It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
Kevin: Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Robert: Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!
Dwight: You okay, Robert?
Robert: Fine.
Dwight: Put some ice on it.
Oscar: In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
Sasha: One, two, three!
Dwight: I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What���s even more precious to people than muffins?'
Jake: Can you just smile, please?
Meredith: I don't want to!
Dwight: ...their own children.
Dwight: Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
Angela: No thank you.
Dwight: Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
Jim: I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
Jim: Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
Dwight: [Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Jim: Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
Darryl: Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Hide: Bad economy. Bad investment.
Darryl: You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
Calvin: They did not.
Darryl: And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Calvin: I wouldn't.
Darryl: Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
Hide: Coconut penis.
Darryl: The coconut's pretty subtle.
Calvin: Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no?
Darryl: I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Darryl: If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
Andy: [wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.
Jim: How's it going, man?
Andy: [whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
Jim: Great, yeah, good.
Gabe: Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
Nellie: Oh God.
Andy: Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Nellie: No, you don't understand-
Andy: Clean the toilets.
Nellie: I don't need anyone to-
Andy: Pull the poop out of the toilets.
Nellie: That's not even a thing.
Andy: Just, please...
Nellie: Andy.
Andy: Please!
Nellie: Andy.
Andy: Give me something!
Nellie: Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
Andy: Thank you.
Nellie: You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
Andy: Thank you.
Nellie: You don't need to-
Andy: I have a delicious secret.
Creed: Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
Jim: Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Andy: Yeah, it is actually.
Andy: Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
Pam: [enters with the kids] Family picture!
Jim: Pam? No!
Pam: What? Honey, we talked about this.
Jim: No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Pam: Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Jim: No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Pam: No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
Jim: Nope.
Pam: We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
Jim: But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
Pam: No, no.
Jim: Nope.
Pam: But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
Jim: That's-
Pam: Yes!
Jim: That's-
Pam: And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Jim: Okay.
Kevin: Wait, C-R-A-Z...
Dwight: Great, right up there.
Pam: Yeah?
Jim: Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Alright. Why don't you just-
Pam: Oh, great. Thank you.
Jim: -give him to me and... perfect.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: This is great.
Pam: You ready?
Jim: Excuse me.
Pam: There we go.
Jim: Just do it.
Pam: I'll just stand here?
Jim: Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Photographer: Sir, could you look into the camera?
Jim: Let's do it, shoot it.
Photographer: Sir.
Jim: Great.
Dwight: Up here. [whistles]
Jim: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dwight: Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
Jim: Oh, so that's it?
Dwight: That's it.
Pam: See? That wasn't so hard.
Dwight: Cute kids, thanks for coming.
Senator Lipton: Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody.
Angela: Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Senator Lipton: Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op.
Phyllis: [laughs] Yeah.
Angela: Heh.
Erin: Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Senator Lipton: Thanks.
Dwight: Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
Angela: Dwight.
Dwight: Nice to see you. May I hold him?
Senator Lipton: Sure.
Angela: No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
Angela: I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
Angela: [Phillip cries] See the duckie!
Dwight: Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Senator Lipton: Oh, thank you.
Angela: [slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Dwight: Really?
Andy: This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
Andy: Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
Nellie: Well, I don't want any soup.
Andy: But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!
Nellie: Oh come on, Andy!
Erin: I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Andy: A delicious moment.
Erin: But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Andy: Well, but it-
Erin: Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Dwight: Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Angela: Uh-uh, leave us alone.
Senator Lipton: I guess we're okay with the fingernails.
Dwight: Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
Angela: Dwight, we're fine!
Senator Lipton: Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?
Angela: Oh no. [laughs]
Senator Lipton: I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
Dwight: He defecated, aw.
Senator Lipton: You're stinky.
Darryl: A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Brandon: That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that.
Val: Uh, Brandon?
Darryl: I would.
Brandon: You would?
Darryl: Yeah.
Brandon: Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend.
Val: Calm down, he's not.
Darryl: Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
Brandon: [scoffs] So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
Val: Brandon!
Darryl: Good slam.
Brandon: Thank you, Biggie.
Darryl: Good luck to you.
Brandon: Oh, and have a burger for me.
Senator Lipton: Okay, shall we take a few more?
Angela: I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
Senator Lipton: Okay. There we go.
Angela: No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
Dwight: Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Toby: Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
Nellie: You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
Andy: I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Jim: No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Erin: No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
Nellie: What?
Pam: You hit her?
Andy: No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
Erin: He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
Andy: That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
Gabe: [enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!
Nellie: Oh, get out, skeleton man!
Toby: I can refer you to someone to talk to.
Andy: [his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.
Toby: Give you a name or-
Andy: I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
Jim: Oh boy.
Pam: Oh, Andy.
Oscar: What?
Andy: I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
Oscar: David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Andy: Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.
Jim: Andy, come on.
Kevin: Even I know that's weird.
Andy: I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
Toby: Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
Andy: Stop saying my name.
Erin: No, he's not making this up.
Andy: Thank you, Erin.
Erin: Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Pam: But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
Erin: Oh my God.
Andy: Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
Toby: Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
Dwight: [into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
Kelly: Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
Ravi: I do adore you.
Robert: Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this.
Andy: Yeah, I know.
Robert: Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.
Jim: Hey.
Others: Hey!
David: Hey guys, long time.
Pam: David, what are you doing here?
Phyllis: Is it true you're buying the company?
David: Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
Andy: What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
David: I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
Andy: But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
David: Yes, as we've discussed-
Andy: What?
David: But it's very possible-
Andy: Oh my God!
David: Probable.
Andy: Wow. From janitor to manager?
David: Yep.
Andy: That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
David: There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
Andy: From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Stanley: Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
David: Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
Andy: I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
Phyllis: So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
David: Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Robert: Oof. [laughs] Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I'm actually the CEO.
David: Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
Robert: Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.
David: Well, okay. Great to meet you.
Robert: Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis.
David: Pleasure.
Robert: I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
David: That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
Robert: Please. [laughs]
Andy: Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Jim: Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Andy: Gosh, I hope so.
Angela: No! God, Mose! God!
Mose: Hi, Angela.
Angela: Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Mose: I'm not supposed to say.
Angela: Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Darryl: [taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Val: [stands next to him] Right here?
Darryl: Cool.
Andy: Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
Nellie: May I say one thing?
Andy: It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
Nellie: The quality of mercy is not strained.
Andy: No.
Nellie: It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Andy: Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
Nellie: It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Andy: I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
Andy: If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Nellie: Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
Andy: All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
David: Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
Meredith: Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
David: But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
Robert: David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
David: I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
Robert: Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
Andy: Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
Robert: Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.
Andy: Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
Robert: It's been a great year.
Dwight: Hello.
Angela: Where is it?
Dwight: They're testing it now.
Angela: How long does it take to get the results?
Dwight: Seventy-two hours.
Angela: You're gonna wait here?
Dwight: Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]
Angela: [Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Senator Lipton: Hey.
Oscar: Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
Senator Lipton: You didn't call.
Oscar: Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
Senator Lipton: You know what this is about. [covers Phillip's eyes] Call.
Dwight: The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
CameraMan: We���re getting bonus footage for the DVD.
Dwight: pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
CameraMan: It���ll be a pledge gift.
Dwight: PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Dwight: In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I���m getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there���s a mini-reunion. A kind of a ���where are they now��� panel at a local theatre. It���ll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven���t seen Kevin since we let him go.
Dwight: [mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
Kevin: Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Stanley: Ah, I���ve been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Meredith: Speech!
Dwight: No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is���for���Kevin.
Kevin: Yes! Wait, why?
Dwight: Go ahead and just read the frosting.
Kevin: ���Get out.���
Dwight: Uh-huh.
Kevin: What does that mean?
Dwight: It���s a colloquial way of saying ���you���re fired,��� Kevin, which you are.
Pam: What? Dwight, you can���t do that.
Dwight: The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
All: What?!
Dwight: Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
All: Dwight���[overlapping objections]
Dwight: Based���on his merit.
Oscar: Ooh.
Jim: Umm���.
Kevin: I���m���good.
Pam: Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone���s ever been fired, Toby���s blocked it, so���
Toby: Yeah. Yeah, I don���t think���
Dwight: Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here���s your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
Kevin: [crying] At least I got chocolate.
Jim: I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it���s good for the environment too.
Jim: Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Crowd: Whoo! Yeah
Jim: [to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Jim: And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Pam: [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
Angela: [whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She���s disgusting. Those feet. They���re like the paws of an orangutan.
Pam: I think she looks good. Now that she���s wearing sports bras, we don���t see her boobs as much.
Dwight: That is all. Have a good morning.
Meredith: Thank you.
Dwight: [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
Angela: [laughing] To remind you that our wedding���s gonna be wonderful.
Dwight: Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
Angela: D, it���s gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Dwight: Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he���s been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
Angela: I don���t���I don���t know why.
Dwight: I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band ���The Grass Roots��� in the 1960���s. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
Phyllis: Oh, some fudge?
Malcolm: Oh, thanks. I love your fudge.
Phyllis: Thanks.
Malcolm: I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
Phyllis: [laughing] Oh, you can afford it.
Phyllis: After 16 years, it���s strange sitting across from somebody who isn���t Stanley. But���he���ll get there.
Jim: Okay, the limo���s gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready ���cause I want to pack in a lot.
Zeke: Party time! Whorehouse!
Jim: Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight���s night, okay?
Zeke: Well, you���re the bestisch mensch.
Jim: Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He���s putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I���ve done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight���only good surprises. ���Guten Pranken���. [chuckles]
Dwight: Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won���t be necessary tonight.
Clark: Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Jim: Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn���t going to show up?
Dwight: Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he���s been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Jim: Mose has been weird? That���s so unlike him.
Andy: Yeah, sure, I���ll talk about it. Why not? American���s next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
Casey Dean: You can���t just sit here and cry.
Andy: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
Andy: Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
Bill Hader: [fake crying]
Seth Mayers: Oh, Don���t. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don���t be such a baby.
Bill Hader: [crying and pouring eye drops in his eyes]
Seth Mayers: Oh, No. It���s gonna be alright.
Bill Hader: [pulling multiple tissues out]
Seth Mayers: It���s gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I���m Seth Meyers. That���s Baby Wawa. Good night.
Bill Hader: [still crying] Bye!
Andy: After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
Oscar: [on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby���s. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you���hold on.
Dakota: Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It���s..it���s all over the place. I don���t know what it means.
Oscar: That���s the reason Kevin got fired. It���s his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] ���A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.��� He was home by 4:45 that day.
Nellie: Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I���m looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can���t wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Toby: Hello! [laughing] Hello!
Nellie: Oh.
Toby: Hi! [goes to hug Nellie]
Nellie: No.
Toby: Oh. [laughs nervously]
Nellie: How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Toby: Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Nellie: No. And I thought I unfriended you.
Toby: Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
Toby: [alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know ���cause they have to give you one month���s notice before they leave.
Andy: Hey-OH!
Meredith: Andy?
Oscar: You���re back?
Andy: Yeah.
Malcolm: [whispering to Phyllis] That���s Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!
Jim: Hey man, good to see you.
Andy: Thank you. Yeah,
Phyllis: [hugging Andy]. Andy���
Andy: Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Phyllis: Andy, I���ve been worried about you. How are you?
Andy: A little warm.
Phyllis: Poor, poor Andy.
Andy: [struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
Darryl: Hello, hello.
Jim: Hey!
Meredith: Darryl!
Andy: Hey!
Darryl: Hey, what���s up?
Andy: Didn���t I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
Darryl: What? Must���ve been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Andy: Hmm.
Darryl: Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um���I didn���t call ���cause I figured you changed the number.
Andy: No I didn���t change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Dwight: What? Ooh!
Andy: Surprise!
Dwight: I thought you guys couldn���t come.
Darryl: Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Jim: Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? ���Guten Prank��� number one.
Darryl: You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Dwight: Uh, better ask Jim.
Jim: And Jim will say nothing.
Pam: [enters] Darryl! Andy!
Andy: Hey! Pam!
Darryl: Hey, Pam! How are you?
Pam: We���re fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I���m sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn���t you be?
Andy: Mm-hmm.
Pam: Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How���s the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
Darryl: I love it. And it���s Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
Jim: Yeah?
Darryl: Yeah. Yeah, it���s hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are���for real.
Jim: Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo���s here. Let���s do this. Change if you need to.
Oscar: Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Pam: Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
Oscar: Yeah!
Andy: Aw!
Darryl: Woah-Oh! Haven���t been in one of these in forever.
Oscar: They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich��. I���m a man. So I���m going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
Oscar: WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
Dwight: Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn���t on the itinerary.
Jim: Get out.
Dwight: Jim���wha��� Come on! What���what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
Jim: No, Dwight. You���ll be doing the whacking.
Dwight: A bazooka. You remembered.
Jim: Of course I did.
Dwight: [tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.
All: OH! [all laugh and applaud after Dwight fires the bazooka]
Dwight: Woo! Okay!
Jim: Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
Jim: Private Room.
Oscar: Yeah, brosef.
Dwight: Amazing.
Jim: Enjoy, enjoy.
Guy: Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry?
Jim: Okay, man, easy.
Guy: [fake cries]
Jim: Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Andy: Jim, it���s fine. He���ll just get you on his cell phone and then that���ll go viral.
Darryl: That happens a lot?
Andy: Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
Oscar: Well, I bet it was a smash.
Andy: That���s how I got my new job in the admissions office.
Oscar: Is that a volunteer program or���
Andy: No. It���s a job. Things are going great.
Darryl: Let���s get a drink in you, huh?
Andy: Yes.
Meredith: Whoo-hoo. Let���s get this party started!
Rachel: Where���s my angel.
Angela: This is my big sister Rachel.
Rachel: No, this is my big sister Angela.
Angela: [laughs] We���re very close. We even have our own special language.
Rachel: [speaks in a special language]
Angela: People love it.
Rachel: They do.
Dwight: [sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Stripper: Hi, boys!
All: Ohh���
Clark: Here we go!
Dwight: Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
Stripper: Hey, did somebody order the chef special?
Darryl: Right there.
Dwight: No, we haven���t ordered anything. No one���s even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Stripper: I bet you boys have a big appetite.
Dwight: Oh, we do. So we���ll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
Stripper: Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want.
Dwight: Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that���s not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
Stripper: Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight���s lips]
Dwight: Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef���s special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won���t work. That���s no good.
Erin: Whoo!
Angela: What? [knock at the door] Okay.
Pam: Oh, boy.
Erin: Oh!
Jakey: Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed or cleaned or whatever.
Phyllis: Angela���s special repairman is here.
Angela: Wait, what is this?
Meredith: Shut up. Jakey?
Jakey: Mom?
Pam: Wait, wait. What?
Jakey: Oh, man.
Meredith: No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom���s not here.
Pam: Uh, that seems inappropriate.
Meredith: Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
Jakey: Okay.
Meredith: Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper���s only as good as his song.
Rachel: oh, wowee wow.
Angela: Okay���
Pam: Whoo-hoo���go, Meredith���s stripper son.
Angela: Rachel, are you all right?
Rachel: I don���t know!  I don���t know.
Angela: Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Meredith: Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Angela: Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
Meredith: Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
Angela: [Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It���s o���thank you. You know what? You don���t have to���oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It���s okay.
Dwight: Now, for the last time, I���d like a side salad with balsamic.
Clark: Dwight, for the last time, she���s not a waitress.
Dwight: You���re telling me!
Oscar: If you want her to leave, just tip her.
Dwight: What for? We haven���t even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren���t deep fried, right?
Angela: That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Phyllis: It���s just the wind.
Angela: Will you lock the door?
Phyllis: Okay. [opens door] It���s just the wind, see? Nothing.
Angela: Alright, see, you don���t have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It���s the wind. Just come and shut���[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
All: [screams]
Erin: Phyllis!
Rachel: What���s happening?
Dwight: Oh, man, never thought I���d say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Jim: Oh, it���s the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela���s been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Dwight: Good old Mose. [laughing]
Jim: They think it was Mose.
Dwight: Oh, great. He���s getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
Oscar: What is that?
Dwight: A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Jim: Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you���d ever set foot in in this town?
Dwight: Right. Which one is that?
Jim: Mm, hey driver. Why don���t you take us to 3030 Adams?
Jim: Is that Mose?
Dwight: Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
Mose: Well, first, buy us a drink.
All: If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink.
Dwight: Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
Kevin: Well, well, well, well, well, well. That���s six ���wells.��� Did I get that number right, Dwight?
Dwight: I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
Kevin: Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Dwight: [to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
Jim: Ooh.
Dwight: You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
Jim: Nope, not a prank. I think it���s time for you to bury the hatchet.
Dwight: Waste of a good hatchet.
Jim: Okay, just talk.
Kevin: Well, w���
Dwight: I heard you say ���well��� the first time.
Jim: I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow���s his wedding day. You can���t be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Dwight: It was nothing personal. It���s just that you were terrible at your job.
Kevin: You���re just saying that to make me feel better.
Dwight: No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Kevin: Is that all it was?
Dwight: That���s it.
Kevin: Come here [hugs Dwight]
Dwight: I missed you Kevin.
Kevin: I missed you!
Dwight: Ohh.
Mose: Guten Prank.
Jim: Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
Dwight: You���ve had your drink. Now where is my bride?
Dwight: Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]
Angela: What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
Jim: Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or���
Dwight: No. We can���t see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
Jim: Right.
Stanley: Hey guys.
All: Stanley!
Erin: How���s Florida?
Stanley: Oh, great.
Stanley: Yes, I���m living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Jim: Am I the only one that���s nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Pam: No, no, I���m fine.
Jim: Doesn���t seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Stanley: I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
Andy: I���m sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
Kevin: [watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It���s in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Kevin: [laughing] Yeah, people hate you.
Andy: I���ll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Man: Hey! It���s Andy Bernard!
All: Nard Dog! [cheers and claps] Ree-De-De-De-Doo! [repeats]
Andy: Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
Man 1: How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv?
David Wallace: It���s like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It���s kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn���t wanna know any of it.
Dwight: With today���s modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it���s our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Pete: Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So��� thanks PBS.
Woman 1: Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we���d all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?
Pam: Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don���t know. I���m working on something.
Jim: She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that���s fine.
All: Awww.
Jim: O-Kay.
Woman 2: All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that��� he could do anything. Anything.
Pam: [pause] I���m sorry. Is there a question?
Woman 2: Uh, no.
Man 2: Pam, what was in that teapot letter?
Pam: Oh, um, well, you know, I��� I just��� I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you���d been filmed for nine years of your life, there���d be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
Man 2: I hear ya. What did it say?
Moderator: We���re gonna move on. Next question please.
Man 3: Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody���s actually filming you anymore?
Toby: Yes.
Woman 3: I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?
Meredith: I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn���t show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
Woman 4: I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you���re soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?
Jim: Um, you know what, I actually didn���t handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Pam: Listen, um��� I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn���t want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he���s shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it���s better than a fairy tale. It���s like a long book that you never want to end.  And you���re fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
Woman 4: Like Harry Potter.
Pam: Yeah, like Harry Potter.
Joan: I have a question for Erin.
Erin: Really?
Joan: Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother.
Erin: Thank you.
Joan: So my question is, um, do��� don���t you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her.
Erin: Maybe sometimes. But not like ���hate��� hate. More just like, ���Mom, I hate you!��� And then she would say ���go to your room, young lady.��� And I���d stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we���d just have dinner together. But I don���t know. I���d have to meet her. Thanks.
Joan: Erin���
Erin: Yes?

Ryan: Kelly, you���re here.
Kelly: Hey, Ryan!
Ryan: Hey.
Kelly: Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Ryan: No, this little guy is mine.
Ryan: So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
Ryan: Say ���hi���, Drake.
Kelly: Drake is your baby���s name?
Ryan: Yeah.
Kelly: That is an amazing name. I���m obsessed with Drake. His last album��� it just touched me to pieces.
Ryan: No Kelly, he���s no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It���s Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Kelly: Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I���m obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
Ravi: They���re called premature, sweetie. It���s good to see you again Ryan.
Phyllis: Let me help you us.
Angela: Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
Pam: Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
Angela: No, my heels aren't too high. It���s because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn���t know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Phyllis: Oh, I���m gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
Jim: You ready?
Dwight: [chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Jim: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um��� I don���t know how to tell you this, but��� we have a little bit of a problem.
Dwight: Oh, no. What?
Jim: The minister just told me that it���s tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
Dwight: Oh, come on. I���ve never heard of such a thing.
Jim: I haven���t heard of it, obviously. But I���m out because I am significantly younger than you-
Dwight: Not��� significant is a big word���
Jim: I think it���s definitely��� Well, okay. Either way���
Dwight: I think you���re only a teeny���
Jim: Either way, Dwight��� I can���t be there for you. I���m sorry.
Dwight: Jim.
Jim: I just���really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
Dwight: [turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can���t believe you came.
Michael: That���s what she said.
Jim: Best prank ever.
Minister: As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do.
Nellie: [to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
Kevin: [reading] ���Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. ���
Minister: I now pronounce you man and wife. [everyone cheers] Release the doves! [doves do not move right away]
Kelly: Oh.
Kevin: That���s not���
Dwight: Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They���ll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab ���em on in there.
Dwight: Everybody!
Jim: [dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don���t owe me anything.
Ryan: Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he���s hot.
Ravi: Oh, no.
Ryan: I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Ravi: Oh, yeah, you���re not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?
Ryan: Actually, could you go inside? I���m feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
Ravi: Are you sure you don���t wanna go in?
Kelly: Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn���t this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Ryan: Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
Kelly: I don���t know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn���t look so good.
Ryan: He���ll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He���s allergic but he���ll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Kelly: You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
Pam: Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
Pam: [with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it���s choreographed!
Pam: He just so happy to have a family plan.
Ed: Where���d you learn to dance like that?
Erin: I don���t know. I���ve just always been really good at dancing.
Toby: [dancing with Pam] [sobbing]
Pam: Is it me? Is it Nellie?
Toby: [sobbing] It���s everything.
Phyllis: [dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
Stanley: I missed you too.
Phyllis: Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson���s a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It���s me. It���s me.
Ryan: I love you.
Kelly: [laughing] I love you too.
Ryan: We���re gonna be together forever.
Kelly: We���re running off into the sunset.
Ryan: I finally mastered commitment.
Kevin: [to Oscar] What was that stuff?
Ravi: Hey, has anyone seen Ryan��� or Kelly?
Kevin: Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Ravi: Oh, that���s it. Here. [hands Drake to Kevin] Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We���ll find a better parent than Ryan in no time.
Kevin: Oh, I don���t know.
Nellie: Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will��� who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
Kevin: Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
Nellie: Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
Nellie: If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We���ll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won���t we?
Michael: [crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It���s every parent���s dream.
Darryl: Thank you go much.
Dwight: Good night.
Toby: Good luck.
Val: Great. It was really fun.
Dwight: Good evening.
Val: The Doc crew���s throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
Darryl: Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Toby: Oh, I don���t know. I might turn in early.
Andy: It���s only 6:00. Come on, everybody���s going.
Meredith: You have to go, Toby.
Pete: Yeah, come on, Tobes.
Val: Come on.
Toby: Yeah. I���ll stop by.
Pete: There he is!
Pam: I need to get out of this dress.
Jim: I gotta get out of this dress.
Carol Stills: Oh, I���m sorry Pam.
Jim: What���s going on?
Pam: [sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?
Carol: [whispering] I���m so sorry. They were an hour late.
Jim: No, really, what���s going on?
Pam: Okay, Okay. Um��� so��� this past year has been really great, and you���ve been great and I just��� I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn���t be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture��� and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
Jim: Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Pam: About 2 months
Jim: That���s why it���s so clean.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Pam: Well, you��� you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Jim: Oh��� okay. Where would we go?
Pam: Austin? Maybe.
Jim: I promise you, you don���t have to do this for me.
Pam: I���m doing it for us.
Jim: The last���
Buyer: Okay. We���ll take it.
Jim: [to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about���
Pam: Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
Buyer: We wanna buy your house.
Jim: You wanna do this?
Pam: I wanna do this.
Jim: You really want to do this?
Pam: I really want to do this!
Jim: [hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!
Jim: Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
Darryl: What? All right!
Pam: We���re so excited.
Phyllis: Cool.
Woman: Oh, that���s for PBS executives only.
Stanley: I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
David Wallace: I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I���d love to contribute to your campaign.
Oscar: Thank you David.
Pam: Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper���,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I���ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
Pam: Everyone, Let���s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just���I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
Photographer: [taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that���s great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody.
Jim: [whispering to Pam] Let���s go outside
Pam: Okay.
Stanley: Okay, I need a drink.
Kevin: Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith���s drawer] What the���there���s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Meredith: Hey, bottom drawer.
Kevin: Yes!
Pam: [answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I���m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn���t work here anymore.
Pam: I didn���t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It���s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It���d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I���m a tragic person. I���m really happy now. But���it would just���just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself ���be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn���t that long.���
Kevin: If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it���s that if you film anybody long enough, they���re going to do something stupid. It���s only human natural.
Dwight: Hey guys.
Angela: Hi.
All: Hey!
Pam: What about the honeymoon?
Angela: Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
Dwight: Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
Jim: You know what? Maybe we should talk.
Darryl: Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
Kevin: What is it?
Andy: [on the computer] You���re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
Pam: I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing���
Jim: Athleap.
Pam: And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We���ll come back to visit. But I think it���s time for us to officially���
Dwight: No, don���t say it. You���re fired! You���re both fired!
Jim: Dwight, come on. Don���t end on a bad note.
Dwight: Don���t be an idiot. It���s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you���ve been here. That���s the max.
Pam: Thanks Dwight.
Jim: Hey, and if you���re ever in Austin...
Dwight: Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you���re ever in the area, you���ll always have a place to stay���in my barn.
Jim: There it is.
Dwight: Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don���t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So��� have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let���s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So���yes. I���d say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
Andy: [on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you���re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
Kevin: Oh, Yes!
Darryl: You did good. Real good.
Andy: Thanks Dad���Darryl.
Andy: I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I���m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I���m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they���re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you���re in the good old days before you���ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
Oscar: You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It���s not much. But if you see it in the right way���And that���s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn���t once show me doing my origami.
Creed: [walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
Creed: [playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn���t matter. ���Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same���
Jim: Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes���and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that���s���an amazing gift.
Phyllis: Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
Jim: Thanks Phyl.
Creed: I still have my medal from that.
Angela: Do you even have a mattress?
Creed: No, but I still have my medal from that.
Kevin: Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I���m gay.
Oscar: Why do you say that?
Kevin: [sniffles] It���s just that I���m so emotional.
Oscar: Yeah, but you���re not gay. You���re not gay.
Kevin: No, but maybe the reason���
Oscar: You���re not gay.
Creed: [still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
Erin: How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Darryl: Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
Creed: It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But���[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let���s do this.
Meredith: I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they���re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You���re not alone sister. Let���s get a beer sometime.
Phyllis: I���m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
Jim: I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn���t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid���wonderful���boring���amazing job.
Pam: I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all���I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There���s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn���t that kind of the point?
