Kevin: So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Pam: No.
Kevin: Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Jim: Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Phyllis: Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Pam: Yeah?
Phyllis: Yeah, pretty stationery.
Pam: Oh, thanks!
Angela: I didn't get mine yet.
Pam: Uh...
Pam: There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Michael: Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
Phyllis: Uh, on or off?
I.D. Photographer: Off.
Phyllis: Okay... [removes glasses]
Dwight: Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Phyllis: [leaving the room] Excuse me.
Dwight: Clown paint.
Dwight: I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Michael: That's a nice tie.
Ryan: Thank you.
Michael: That is... who makes that?
Ryan: Um, I don't...
Michael: Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Ryan: Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.
Oscar: It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Michael: [walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?
Toby: Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Michael: What's the problem?
Oscar: Angela!
Toby: It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Oscar: Since Christmas.
Michael: So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Oscar: No.
Toby: Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Michael: Yes.
Toby: Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
Michael: Yeah?
Toby: These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Michael: Okay.
Toby: It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
Michael: What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Toby: Okay.
Michael: Okay... what?
Toby: That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Michael: Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
Michael: [holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
Angela: Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Michael: No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Oscar: What's the next one?
Michael: Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Angela: Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
Michael: Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
Michael: [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
Angela: I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Michael: Come on, seriously, that?
Oscar: I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
Michael: Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Pam: Win!
Michael: Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
Oscar: No.
Angela: That's... no...
Michael: Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Angela: How about, I leave it up?
Oscar: How 'bout, she takes it down?
Pam: How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Michael: Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
Pam: Win.
Oscar: Fine.
Angela: But, it...
Michael: [claps his hands twice] It is done!
Pam: Win
Photographer: [snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile shot] No, you're all good.
Creed: Great. [gets up and leaves]
Pam: Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
Angela: Oh. Thanks.
Angela: It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
Toby: You solved it?
Michael: Yes.
Toby: Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
Michael: Are those all the other complains?
Toby: Mmm-Hm.
Michael: I would like to see those please.
Toby: I... I can't do that.
Michael: You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Toby: That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
Michael: Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?
Toby: [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Toby: Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
Michael: Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
Photographer: Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]
Dwight: Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
Photographer: [shoots twice]
Michael: [looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
Pam: Nice.
Michael: You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Toby: Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
Michael: How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
Angela: You already did me.
Michael: That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
Toby: Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Michael: Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
Dwight: Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
Pam: [notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Michael: All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Pam: Wait, what did it say?
Michael: Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
Pam: I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Michael: Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.
Ryan: My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
Kelly: I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
Toby: To your HR representative.
Kelly: To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
Toby: Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
Michael: [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?
Jim: Dwight tried to kiss me.
Michael: What?!
Jim: And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Dwight: That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Jim: Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Dwight: Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
Toby: Sure.
Michael: Stanley. [off camera]
Pam: [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Michael: [still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Anglea: I didn't do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it's inaudible]
Pam: I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Michael: Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.
Stanley: I didn't say that.
Creed: Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
Michael: Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
Phyllis: No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Michael: And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Phyllis: Stanley and I are close, too.
Stanley: We sit close.
Michael: Oh... ok.
Toby: [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
Pam: I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
Jim: Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Pam: Don't take her side.
Jim: [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Pam: I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Jim: You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Yeah...
Phyllis: I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
Angela: Yes, that's the problem.
Phyllis: I guess so...
Michael: Okay, well... all settled, then.
Phyllis: [whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
Michael: OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
Creed: I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Michael: All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Kevin: I accept your decision!
Jim: Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
Dwight: That doesn't make any sense.
Jim: Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Photographer: [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.
Dwight: No.
Dwight: I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Jim: This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
Dwight: This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Jim: Oh.
Dwight: And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
Jim: What did I write?
Dwight: I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Toby: Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
Dwight: What box?!
Phyllis: But I didn't report your snoring-
Stanley: Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
Michael: Uh. Dwight.
Dwight: Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Michael: Okay! Calm down.
Dwight: No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Michael: Hey, hey!
Dwight: Him or me?
Michael: Stop.
Dwight: Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Michael: Okay...
Dwight: Either he goes, or I go.
Michael: Dwight...
Dwight: You choose!
Michael: Stop...
Dwight: One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
Michael: Oh... kay...
Dwight: I am not bluffing!
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Okay?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: I deserve this. You know I do!
Michael: [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Dwight: You have till five.
Dwight: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Michael: Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Michael: Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Michael: Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'
Jim: [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Michael: [reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'
Jim: That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Michael: [reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'
Jim: Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Michael: By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'
Jim: Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Michael: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
Jim: Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Dwight: It's a good market. Higher volume.
Jim: Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Dwight: I have a girlfriend...
Jim: Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Michael: Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
Dwight: So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Michael: Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
Dwight: I want an answer by tomorrow.
Michael: Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
Dwight: Fine.
Michael: Good. Okay.
Michael: Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Photographer: I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
Michael: Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
Photographer: You mean digital?
Michael: It'll take like two seconds.
Photographer: 20 bucks.
Michael: Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
Stanley: You gotta be kiddin' me.
Michael: Come on, everybody.
Dwight: Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Photographer: One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.
Michael: We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Photographer: Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three...  whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]
Michael: Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
Photographer: That'll be another 20.
Michael: What?
Pam: Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
Michael: [off camera] You just press the button.
Angela: What?
Jim: No, Pam.
Pam: [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
Jim: Pam, it wasn't her.
Pam: What?!
Jim: I'm the one who complained about you.
Jim: I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
Michael: [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.
Jim: You know, it was one day.
Michael: [off camera] That's terrible.
Jim: And I took it right back. It was like...
Pam: Okay.
Phyllis: Oh, dear.
Michael: [off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
Michael: It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
Michael: [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?
Michael: But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
Jim: [on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Female worker: Okay, Jan will see you now.
Jim: Oh, thanks.
Michael: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
Dwight: [elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Jim: I don't know.
Dwight: Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
Jim: Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Dwight: A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
Jim: Probably is.
Dwight: Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
Pam: [telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
Dwight: Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
Jim: Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
Dwight: This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
Jim: That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Dwight: No, there's no blood.
Jim: Maybe poison?
Dwight: Possibly.
Jim: My God!
Dwight: [exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
Michael: Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
Ryan: I know.
Michael: On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
Photographer: [Dwight slurping] Okay, here we go. One, two...
Dwight: He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
Michael: I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.
Dwight: I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
Photographer: So there were no death threats?
Dwight: Let me see your ID.
Michael: There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.
Michael: There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.
Photographer: All right.
Pam: That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
Photographer: Would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that?
Jim: Not bad.
Dwight: I gave her a higher clearance than you.
Jim: What does Level Red mean?
Dwight: I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
Meredith: Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
Kevin: No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.
Phyllis: You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
Michael: Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
Phyllis: Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Dwight: I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Phyllis: You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Michael: Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
Hank the Security Guard: Excuse me, sir! Dwight Schrute, is that your real name?
Dwight: Yes, sir.
Kevin: Morning.
Hank the Security Guard: Good morning. Okay, go ahead.
Dwight: Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
Michael: Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.
Jim: Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
Dwight: I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Pam: It's a nice tux.
Dwight: I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
Roy: So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
Pam: Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
Dwight: Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Jim: I can always kind of win at roulette.
Dwight: Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: How would you do that?
Jim: Mind control.
Dwight: [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
Jim: Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Dwight: I don't believe you. Continue.
Jim: It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Dwight: [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
Jim: Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
Dwight: Oh, my God.
Michael: I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Jan: [on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Michael: Top 80 percent!
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Jan: You know that I'm very serious here.
Michael: Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Jan: What?
Michael: Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
Jan: I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Michael: I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Jan: [laughs] I think you can handle it.
Michael: Oh, come on. Come on.
Jan: I think so, Michael...
Michael: You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Jan: Goodbye, Michael.
Michael: Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
Michael: Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Oscar: Again? We do that every year.
Michael: Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Oscar: It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Michael: Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Jim: That doesn't exist anymore.
Michael: Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Pam: No, they stopped making that show.
Michael: Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
Angela: You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
Creed: There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Kevin: Something with animals. Or people.
Kelly: Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
Angela: We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Michael: Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
Toby: Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
Michael: Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
Jim: I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Michael: No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
Phyllis: Afghani.
Michael: What?
Phyllis: Afghani.
Michael: That's a dog.
Pam: No, that's Afghan.
Michael: That's a shawl.
Dwight: Wait, canine AIDS?
Michael: No. Humans with AIDS.
Creed: Who has AIDS?
Jim: Guys, the Afghanistananies.
Michael: Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
Michael: There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
Jim: What are you doing?
Pam: Oh, nothing.
Jim: Till Death Do Us Rock.'
Pam: They're wedding bands.
Jim: Oh.
Pam: Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
Jim: Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
Pam: There's a KISS cover band in here.
Jim: Let's do it.
Pam: I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
Jim: Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
Michael: I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
Darryl: Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Michael: It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Darryl: Except my warehouse.
Michael: Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
Dwight: Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
Michael: Why are you here?
Dwight: When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
Michael: Not. I said, not that.
Darryl: We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Michael: That's ironic.
Darryl: What?
Michael: That you are afraid.
Darryl: Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
Michael: Dinkin' flicka.
Darryl: [sighs] Dinkin' flicka.
Darryl: I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Michael: Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
Darryl: Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Jim: [Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Pam: I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Jim: Yes.
Pam: Have three stages, yeah.
Jim: Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Pam: Oh.
Jim: Let's take a look. Nice.
Pam: Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.
Jim: What?
Pam: On the drums! On the drums!
Jim: Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
Kevin: We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Jim: Wow. Oh!
Pam: Oh, my...
Jim: Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
Pam: No! No!
Jim: No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Pam: No, come back! No, no, no!
Jim: Kev!
Pam: Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
Michael: [phone rings] Yes
Pam: [phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Michael: Who?
Pam: Carol Stills.
Michael: Do I know a Carol Stills?
Pam: Your realtor.
Michael: Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
Pam: It's still me.
Pam: Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Pam: Carol, you're on with Michael.
Carol: [on phone] Hello, Michael?
Michael: Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Carol: I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Michael: Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Carol: Oh, great.
Michael: Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
Carol: Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
Michael: Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Carol: Oh, great.
Michael: Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Carol: To the casino thing?
Michael: Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
Carol: What?
Michael: Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Pam: Michael, Jan's on line two.
Michael: Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
Pam: It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Hey, Jan. How you doing?
Jan: You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Michael: I am?
Jan: I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jan: Incidentally, what is the charity?
Michael: AIDS.
Jan: Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
Michael: Okay, sounds great.
Jan: Bye-bye.
Michael: Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Carol: No problemo.
Michael: Right.
Carol: To answer your question...
Michael: Yeah?
Carol: Yes.
Michael: What?
Carol: I'd love to go.
Michael: Okay.
Carol: I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
Michael: Problem. Good.
Carol: And I'll bring the papers, too.
Michael: Good, All right. Sounds great.
Carol: I'll see you tonight.
Michael: Bye.
Carol: Bye.
Michael: Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Pam: [People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Roy: Yeah! That's great.
Michael: Hey, hey.
Carol: Hi.
Michael: Hey, Carol.
Carol: Hi.
Michael: You look great.
Carol: Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Michael: Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]
Dwight: Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Dwight: I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Michael: Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Carol: Drink would be good.
Michael: Okay.
Creed: Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Billy's Girlfriend: I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
Billy: No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart.
Billy's Girlfriend: Okay.
Michael: Billy, your nurse is hot.
Billy: That's my girlfriend.
Michael: Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Billy: She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.
Michael: Chili's is great.
Michael: Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Stanley: [Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Michael: Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Dealer: Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.
Michael: All-in. [Other players fold their hands]
Michael: Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
Toby: I'll call.
Michael: What are... That's insane.
Toby: I have good cards.
Michael: Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Dealer: No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in.
Michael: Okay, all right, whatever.
Dealer: Flip them.
Michael: You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves]
Meredith: Wow.
Toby: I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
Dwight: I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Jim: [coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Jim: It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Carol: Wow, bad luck.
Michael: Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Jan.
Jan: Hi.
Michael: Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
Jan: What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
Carol: What does that mean?
Michael: After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
Jan: No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
Carol: Hi, hi.
Jan: Does anyone want a drink?
Carol: No, I'm good.
Jan: Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]
Michael: Um...
Dwight: Hey, hey.
Michael: Hey. What...
Dwight: Jan's here.
Dwight: Give me the dice.
Kevin: Come on, Dwight.
Dwight: Let's go.
Billy: It's all on you, baby. Let's go.
Angela: Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
Dwight: Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
Kevin: Yes.
Angela: Then roll an eight.
Dwight: Thank you, Angela.
Angela: Good luck, Dwight.
Dwight: Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Kevin: Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
Oscar: Let it ride. Let it all ride.
Dwight: Give me the dice!
Jim: Yeah, right.
Pam: Yeah, right,' what?
Jim: What was this? [Makes face]
Pam: [Laughs] I have good cards.
Jim: Really?
Pam: Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.
Jim: Wow. I think you're bluffing.
Kevin: Yeah, I think she's full of it.
Pam: Straight.
Jim: Oh. Three nines.
Kevin: Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
Jim: Thank you very much. It was fun.
Jan: Cosmopolitan, please.
Carol: Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
Jan: Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
Carol: Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
Jan: Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
Carol: Well, I'm having a nice time.
Jan: Oh, me too. Me too.
Ryan: One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Jim: So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Michael: All right!
Dealer: The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!
Dwight: Come on, shooter!
Michael: Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!
Carol: All right.
Michael: Yeah!
Dealer: Five.
Michael: So close. So close.
Dwight: Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
Jan: What?
Dwight: Super 8?
Jan: No, I...
Dwight: Motel 6? Best Western?
Jan: I didn't... I don't know...
Dwight: Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
Kevin: I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
Kevin: All-in.
Phyllis: Okay, let's do it.
Bob Vance: Good Luck, honey.
Phyllis: Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
Kevin: Three queens.
Dwight: Nice, very nice.
Phyllis: I have an ace.
Oscar: No, that's a flush.
Dwight: Oh, man!
Phyllis: Oh, I have a flush!
Bob: Yes!
Phyllis: Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Kevin: I suck.
Roy: She took you down, huh?
Kevin: I do not want to talk about it.
Roy: Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
Kevin: Yeah?
Roy: Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
Kevin: Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
Roy: Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
Kevin: Dude, you will not be sorry.
Roy: Sweet. All right.
Kevin: All right.
Jan: Smoke?
Jim: No, thanks. You having fun?
Jan: Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Jim: Yeah, we all really...
Jan: Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
Jim: Well, I think you look great.
Jan: Why did I hook up with Michael?
Jim: Yeah, why did you?
Jan: It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Jim: Oh, yeah.
Jan: Good. Have you told anyone?
Jim: No.
Jan: Well, you should.
Bob: Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin!
Creed: Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
Roy: Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
Pam: It's okay. I'll see you at home.
Roy: Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
Pam: Okay.
Roy: If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
Jim: Okay, will do.
Roy: See you.
Pam: Bye! Hey.
Jim: Hey, how's it going?
Pam: Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
Jim: Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Pam: About when you want to give me more of your money?
Jim: No, I...
Pam: Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
Jim: I was just... I'm in love with you.
Pam: What?
Jim: I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Pam: What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Jim: I just needed you to know. Once.
Pam: Well, I um... I... I can't.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: You have no idea...
Jim: Don't do that.
Pam: ...what your friendship means to me.
Jim: Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
Pam: I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
Jim: Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Jan: Hey. I'm leaving.
Michael: Hey, okay.
Jan: So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
Michael: Okay. Thanks for coming.
Jan: Nice to meet you.
Carol: You, too.
Jan: And you guys have a good time together.
Michael: Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Jan: Yeah.
Carol: Goodbye.
Michael: Good night. She's a good boss.
Carol: She seems really nice.
Michael: Oh, she's great.
Michael: Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
Pam: [On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Michael: Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
Dwight: Do you need anything?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Should I get water or donuts?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Come on, let's go. Take a seat.
Oscar: What's going on, Michael?
Michael: I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Dwight: Office Depot!
Michael: Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]
Pam: Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
Michael: How about a location?
Dwight: The planet Caprica.
Michael: Where the hell is that?
Dwight: It's from Battlestar Galactica.
Michael: Okay, all right.
Stanley: I am going back to my desk...
Michael: No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
Stanley: Annoying.
Michael: We already have that. So...
Toby: Frustrating.
Michael: No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
Phyllis: Ass.
Michael: Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
Dwight: Yeah, get them, Creed!
Michael: One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.
Dwight: My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Jim: My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
Dwight: I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
Michael: Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
Darryl: Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
Michael: Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Darryl: What?
Michael: Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company's doing fine.
Darryl: Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Michael: Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.
Michael: Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.
Pam: It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
Meredith's Vet: Hey. Meredith, right?
Meredith: Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
Meredith's Vet: I'm your vet.
Meredith: Oh, right.
Meredith's Vet: And we had sex in the parking lot.
Jim: [to Pam] Hey.
Jim: [Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
Dwight: That is a demerit.
Jim: [reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
Dwight: You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
Jim: Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Dwight: [scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Jim: Lay it on me.
Dwight: Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Jim: Now that sounds serious.
Dwight: Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Jim: Which would be me.
Dwight: That is correct.
Jim: OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Dwight: What's a dis... what's that?
Jim: Oh, you don't want to know.
Pam: [door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
Phyllis: I think I just got flashed.
Pam: What? Really?
Phyllis: In the parking lot.
Pam: Oh, my God.
Dwight: [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
Jim: OK, I'll call the
Andy: What happened? What can I do to help?
Jim: [on the phone] OK.
Andy: I'll check the web.
Jim: [on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Pam: [to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Phyllis: Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
Angela: Phyllis. You're a married woman.
Creed: The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
Creed: If that's flashing, then lock me up.
Pam: [whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.
Ryan: [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
Michael: What's happening?
Pam: Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Michael: Really? Is she OK?
Pam: Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Michael: OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]
Angela: What is so funny?
Michael: Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
Kevin: I'm guessing not.
Michael: [laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Jim: Mm... not really, no.
Pam: It's disgusting and demeaning.
Michael: Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
Toby: Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
Michael: What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]
Toby: What's going on?
Michael: Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]
Toby: I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Michael: Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Toby: I don't think the women in this office -
Michael: Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
Toby: I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Michael: Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
Michael: In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.
Jan: [on speakerphone] Michael, ...
Michael: Huh?
Jan: ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Michael: I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Jan: I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
Michael: Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
Jan: $300?
Michael: I... uh, well, I don't know.
Jan: You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Hunter: [on speakerphone] You got it, Jan.
Dwight: Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Michael: [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
Dwight: Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Michael: OK.
Dwight: [lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Michael: This is the last
Dwight: Look at that one.
Michael: Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
Michael: Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
Dwight: Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Jim: [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Dwight: Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
Pam: Phallus?
Dwight: Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Pam: I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
Phyllis: I didn't really get a good look.
Pam: That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Karen: Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
Dwight: Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Karen: Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Dwight: Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Pam: [reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Michael: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
Karen: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Michael: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
Dwight: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Michael: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
Jim: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Michael: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
Dwight: [eating banana] Mm, less than three.
Michael: That is not current.
Dwight: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Jim: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Dwight: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
Michael: You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Michael: I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Creed: Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Michael: Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
Meredith: I don't remember doing that.
Angela: What a surprise.
Michael: OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
Dwight: Alien
Michael: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
Andy: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
Kevin: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Karen: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
Michael: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
Karen: I'm saying that you're being sexist.
Michael: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Karen: That - it's the same thing.
Phyllis: Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Phyllis: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Michael: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
Angela: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Michael: I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Dwight: I wish I could menstruate.
Dwight: If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Karen: Can we just get back to work?
Michael: Ye - OK, yes.
Angela: This is not work talk.
Michael: You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]
Karen: Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
Angela: Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Michael: OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!
Dwight: Have you finished with the sketch?
Pam: Yeah.
Dwight: Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
Pam: Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
Dwight: Hmm.
Dwight: [Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Pam: [tires screeching] Oh.
Angela: Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Meredith: Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
Pam: Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.
Meredith: My car, my rules.
Kevin: Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
Jim: No. Thank you, though.
Kevin: You aren't curious?
Jim: Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
Kevin: Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.
Jim: I think you mean a girl's
Kevin: [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.
Jim: Go crazy.
Kevin: [in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.
Andy: I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Dwight: Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
Andy: This guy looks like a real deviant.
Dwight: No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Andy: Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Dwight: More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
Michael: [Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]
Meredith: It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Michael: Many women
Dwight: [marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
Jim: [in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Kevin: Yes.
Toby: Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
Jim: Anna Maria's.
Ryan: What's the occasion?
Jim: Six-month anniversary. What?
Ryan: Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Jim: No, we've been dating for six months.
Ryan: Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Jim: Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Ryan: I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Michael: All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
Kelly: Thanks, Michael.
Angela: Thank you, Michael.
Michael: You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
Pam: What do you want to dish about?
Michael: Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.
Pam: OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Kelly: Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Michael: What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Phyllis: Oh, it can be fun.
Michael: Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
Karen: It's a pretty common one.
Michael: I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Angela: OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Angela: Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Pam: Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Michael: Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
Pam: Oh, my God.
Michael: [groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
Karen: That is not healthy behavior.
Michael: No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
Pam: Michael, you need to get out of this.
Michael: No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
Pam: No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
Michael: No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
Pam: Read the pros first.
Michael: OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Phyllis: She does have very nice clothes.
Karen: OK, OK. Um, cons.
Michael: Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
Pam: What was the last one?
Michael: She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Phyllis: No, the one before that.
Michael: I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
Pam: Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Michael: I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
Karen: Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Michael: Yeah, that's smart.
Pam: Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
Michael: That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
Phyllis: I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Michael: I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Phyllis: My mom taught me that.
Michael: Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Pam: No one said it has no calories.
Michael: Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
Michael: Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
Kevin: [in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Toby: I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Creed: What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Kevin: You're in here.
Creed: I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
Kevin: [all get up to leave] OK.
Creed: [wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Michael: Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Karen: Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Phyllis: Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
Pam: I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Angela: [in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Michael: Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do?
Karen: Answer it.
Pam: Don't answer it.
Michael: OK, it stopped.
Kelly: [bang] Whoa.
Meredith: [tires screeching] Crap.
Jim: [snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Kelly: Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Michael: Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
Pam: Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
Michael: Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]
Pam: I think I've got it.
Michael: Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Pam: I don't think we really need that, Michael.
Michael: Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
Pam: You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
Andy: Think we'll find him?
Dwight: Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
Andy: [pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
Dwight: No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
Andy: Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
Dwight: Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
Andy: Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
Dwight: You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
Michael: OK, I am really going to do this.
Pam: Good luck, Michael.
Michael: You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]
Karen: OK, remember, be strong.
Michael: I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.
Pam: Don't leave a -
Michael: [leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Jan: Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: So... we're good?
Michael: Abso-fruit-ly.
Jan: [cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Michael: No... No...
Jan: One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Michael: Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
Jan: Oh. [door closes]
Michael: [sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
Dwight: [phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Jim: Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
Dwight: Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
Jim: No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Dwight: Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Jim: Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
Dwight: You have information about the sex predator?
Jim: I saw him two minutes ago.
Dwight: Where?
Jim: In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
Dwight: [hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
Jan: So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Michael: Love it.
Jan: Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Michael: Uh, yes, I am.
Jan: Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Michael: Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.
Jan: Wait, wait, what cartoons?
Michael: The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
Jan: [Sigh]
Michael: We should really start recycling.
Jan: Right uh, Michael.
Kelly: Hey, what's going on?
Stanley: Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
Kelly: [Screams]
Stanley: Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Bob: Phyllis, you okay? You sure?
Andy: Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
Dwight: I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
Andy: Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
Dwight: If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
Andy: Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.
Andy: I should make you my vichyssoise.
Dwight: I will never be your vichyssoise.
Michael: Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?
Jim: No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Michael: Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
Kelly: [sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
Dwight: Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Michael: I got shotgun.  Damn it.
Andy: Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
Michael: Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!
Pam: It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
Michael: Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.
Jim: That's pretty cool.
Andy: You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Michael: Idiot.
Michael: I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
Michael: Ughh... Blech.
Dwight: OK, where does it hurt?
Michael: Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
Dwight: No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Michael: Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]
Dwight: [reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.'
Michael: Maybe.
Dwight: The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
Michael: Not it. I don't have eggs.
Pam: About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
Dwight: Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Michael: That's possible.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Uh-huh?
Pam: David Wallace is on line one.
Michael: The CFO? Ohh...
Michael: OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
Michael: To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
David: [on phone] Michael, I am calling---
Michael: And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?
David: Jan is out of town right now.
Michael: Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
David: Michael?
Michael: ...you just gots to get your freak on.
David: Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
David: Michael?
Michael: Hmmm.
David: I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Michael: Really?
David: Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Michael: Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
David: That's not necessary.
Michael: May God guide you in your quest.
David: Yes.
Michael: OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Meredith: Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
Michael: Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Oscar: I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Michael: Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.
Toby: Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
Michael: Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
Toby: It's Beach Day...
Michael: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
Michael: I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
Toby: Hey, want my sun screen?
Pam: Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
Toby: Uh-huh.
Pam: Thanks Toby.
Michael: Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
Pam: I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Michael: We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
Michael: What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
Pam: You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
Michael: I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
Pam: I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
Michael: This way to the partay bus.
Kevin: I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
Kevin: [singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Michael: Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
Stanley: Oh, sweet mother of God.
Michael: If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Stanley: Excuse me?
Michael: Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Dwight: Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Michael: Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
Dwight: I hope there will be management parables.
Michael: Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Pam: Like what?
Michael: Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Pam: Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
Michael: Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
Michael: Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!
Angela: Everyone put on sunscreen.
Michael: Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Oscar: What?
Michael: Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Michael: Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
Dwight: I choose Michael!
Michael: I'm not playing.
Dwight: OK, temp.
Michael: Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
Michael: We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Dwight: We will be called Gryffindor.
Jim: Really? Not Slytherin?
Dwight: Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Jim: I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Dwight: He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Jim: [starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Dwight: OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
Stanley: I don't care what you call my team.
Michael: Then I will name your team the Red team.
Stanley: No [crosses arms], the blue team.
Michael: I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Andy: We will be team U.S.A.
Michael: Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Michael: Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
Michael: It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
Stanley: There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Michael: Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]
Oscar: Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Stanley: Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Andy: Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
Kelly: I don't want to hit the big rock!
Andy: Don't worry. You're not...
Kelly: I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Andy: No where near the big rock.
Kelly: [takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Andy: What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
Andy: I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
Jim: [to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Karen: Hole?
Jim: Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Dwight: [to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Ryan: Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
Dwight: What are you saying?
Ryan: You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
Dwight: OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
Ryan: That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Dwight: I am trying to bring team spirit.
Jim: [to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
Karen: [lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Pam: There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
Michael: [off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
Dwight: [at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
Andy: [begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
Michael: Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Pam: Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Michael: Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Pam: When's the contest?
Michael: Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?
Pam: How am I supposed to... get...
Michael: Thanks a bunch.
Michael: A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
Michael: OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
Kelly: Can I have a turkey burger?
Michael: No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Oscar: Turkey is a healthy meat.
Dwight: It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Michael: Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
Phyllis: Is there any mustard?
Michael: No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Michael: Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
Meredith: [eating hot dog] What is it?
Michael: I can't say.
Jim: You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Michael: The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
Kelly: Can we just take those first two things?
Michael: The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
Dwight: You're leaving?
Michael: I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
Andy: [slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Stanley: Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
Michael: [points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.
Stanley: I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Michael: Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
Kelly: Team U.S.A.!
Andy: One came up.
Michael: 13 hot dogs, everybody!
Dwight: Damn it!
Creed: [holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
Dwight: Sabotage.
Angela: What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
Dwight: No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
Angela: I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Dwight: If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Michael: It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Stanley: Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
Michael: Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go.
Karen: Get 'em big boy!
Michael: Aaaaaand, go!
Karen: C'mon, Jim!
Stanley: [growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
Jim: What are you doing?
Michael: Nice, Stanley!
Stanley: [to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
Jim: Yeah. No. Good.
Jim: Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Oscar: If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Dwight: [Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
Michael: One. Two. Three.
Dwight: Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Michael: Excellent!
Dwight: Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Andy: I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
Dwight: That's not why you lost.
Andy: Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
Dwight: Yeah, right.
Andy: Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
Dwight: [bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Andy: [Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
Angela: What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
Andy: Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!
Angela: I don't understand what you want from me.
Andy: Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
Angela: Sorry! Bye, Andy!
Andy: Angela!
Michael: I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
Pam: I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
Michael: Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Pam: I really doubt it, Michael.
Michael: Please just check.
Jim: [on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Karen: Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
Jim: In well?
Karen: As well.
Jim: How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Karen: Yes. uh, huh.
Jim: Wait a minute.
Karen: That would be fine.
Jim: If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
Karen: [whispering] Cut it out!
Jim: I don't!
Michael: What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
Stanley: How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
Michael: Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Michael: Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
Kevin: Are you going to try it?
Angela: I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Kevin: Angela, it is a million degrees.
Pam: I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Michael: No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Pam: I'd like to try it.
Michael: Pointless.
Pam: But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Michael: Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
Jim: Nope.
Michael: Ji.. why not? C'mon.
Jim: Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Michael: You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Jim: That's harsh.
Michael: Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
Andy: [lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Kevin: Why don't you go Michael?
Michael: Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Jim: And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Michael: Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.
Pam: Do you want us to count to three?
Michael: Yes. Count to three, please.
Group: Three. Two. One.
Michael: Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
Group: One. Two. Three!  Go! Do it!  Go, Michael.
Michael: Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Creed: On the go that's after three.
Michael: Okay.
Group: One, two, three, go!
Dwight: No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Michael: Don't, don't.
Dwight: [walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Group: Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving.
Dwight: [standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
Michael: I'm not going to give it to you.
Dwight: [falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
Group: [yelling excitedly for Dwight to get off the coals]
Pam: Michael, do something!
Dwight: Aggggh, that stings!
Michael: Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
Angela: Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
Michael: Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
Kelly: Who's Bob Hope?
Michael: God! He's a comedian.
Kelly: Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Michael: Who's Amanda Bynes?
Kelly: She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
Michael: Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Jim: Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Michael: You are being too modest.
Jim: Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Michael: Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
Dwight: The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
Pam: [breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
Dwight: [finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
Michael: That is a very, very funny story.
Pam: [runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Michael: Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
Group: Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.  They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da.  From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. [overlapping singing of the wrong verses] When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!
Michael: WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
Andy: Nice!
Michael: So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
Phyllis: Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Michael: No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
Pam: Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
Pam: Jim, David Wallace is calling for you.
Jim: Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
Michael: Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?
Pam: You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Michael: Acrimonious.
Michael: This way to the party bus. Good.
Meredith: [Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Michael: It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
Meredith: Um, I forgot my...
Michael: Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
All: Yeah!
Michael: Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]
Dwight: Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
Michael: Nothing.
Dwight: If I guess, will you tell me?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Please?
Michael: No!
Dwight: Is that a sumo suit?
Michael: No.
Dwight: I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Michael: No, we are not.
Dwight: Please tell me. I've been so good...
Michael: You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...
Dwight: Please.
Michael: ...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Dwight: Please.
Meredith: Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Michael: No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
Meredith: Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Michael: Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
Michael: Any questions?
Jim: Just one.
Michael: Yup.
Jim: The torches are lit.
Michael: Yes, for dramatic affect.
Jim: No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Michael: Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
Jim: Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Michael: Set!
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Go!
Phyllis: I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Andy: It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Michael: [sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
Pam: Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
Michael: Because he wasn't following the rules.
Pam: I think they were just having fun.
Michael: But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
Pam: It tells me nothing.
Michael: Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
Pam: There's 800 of them!
Michael: Okay, all right.
Michael: It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...
Meredith: Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
Michael: Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
Phyllis: Is there any mustard?
Michael: No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
Everyone: That's what she said!
Michael: No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?
Dwight: I do!
Michael: Who's got the hungry?
Dwight: I do!
Michael: Come on, Ryan...
Dwight: Let's go.
Michael: Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
Jim: Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
Andy: Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser!
Jim: He's gonna throw up.
Michael: [Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!
Phyllis: The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
Dwight: [Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
Kevin: Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Ryan: Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Michael: You? You haven't made a sale.
Ryan: I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
Michael: Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.
Andy: [in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
Michael: Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
Michael: This is an inflatable sumo suit. [blows] Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed. [blows] And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It's about who is the best boss.  And I don't even care who wins. [blows] It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit... [breathes in] that will tell me all I need to know [blows] or how sumo... [collapses]
Michael: It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]
Jim: LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Pam: Morning Michael!
Michael: Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
Michael: I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
Kelly: So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Jim: You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Kelly: And...
Charles: Hey Kelly?
Kelly: Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Charles: Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Jim: The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Charles: Oh, and Kelly...
Kelly: Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Charles: Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Erin: If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Charles: Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
Kelly: Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Kevin: I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Michael: We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Pam: What should we do now?
Michael: We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
Michael: I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
Michael: I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
Pam: I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
Andy: What do you think?
Dwight: Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Andy: Thank you!
Dwight: Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Ryan: You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Michael: Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Ryan: Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Charles: Hey Jim can I get a, um-
Jim: Hi! [Awkward]
Charles: Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Jim: Sure!
Charles: Yeah.
Jim: Okay.
Jim: What the hell's a rundown?
Jim: When did you need that rundown by?
Charles: As soon as possible.
Jim: Okay.
Charles: Just get it right.
Jim: Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Erin: Oh.
Dwight: You know there's a ghost in this office
Erin: Really?
Dwight: A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Erin: Why was she in this building?
Dwight: Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Erin: That's crazy.
Dwight: Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Erin: Oh my god!
Dwight: It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Erin: Hmm.
Dwight: That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Erin: Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
Dwight: Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Erin: Yeah.
Dwight: Yeah?
Erin: Just got some ice.
Dwight: Erin [eerie voice] Erin...
Andy: Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
Erin: Oops!
Andy: Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
Erin: So I'll see you guys around!
Dwight: Hey buddy.
Michael: Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
Ryan: Pam's better at that stuff
Pam: That is so insulting.
Ryan: How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Pam: Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Ryan: I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Pam: Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Ryan: What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Michael: Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Ryan: Yeah I make originals too.
Pam: Shut up!
Michael: Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Pam: Really!
Ryan: Yeah!
Toby: Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
Michael: Would someone just make the copy?
Toby: I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Michael: Just make that copy okay?
Pam: Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Ryan: That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Pam: I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Ryan: You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Pam: Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Ryan: This is from the sun.
Pam: Oh yeah I bet.
Michael: They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
Pam: Michael, we can hear you.
Michael: I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
Pam: Okay it's my turn.
Ryan: No don't take that, give that back!
Pam: Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Ryan: I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
Pam: You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.'
Ryan: Yeah!
Pam: Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
Ryan: Go make a copy, secretary.
Pam: Come on! Ryan!
Michael: They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Dwight: Hey buddy, what are you up to?
Andy: Um, nerthing?
Dwight: Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Andy: Pffft.
Dwight: Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
Andy: The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
Dwight: And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
Andy: No, that's ridiculous.
Dwight: No no no.
Andy: Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Dwight: Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
Michael: Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Pam: Definitely.
Michael: Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam: We could work from home.
Ryan: Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Michael: Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
Pam: .... Corner idea?
Michael: No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
Ryan: Rock the house!
Pam: How would we know that?
Jim: Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
Oscar: Use it in a sentence.
Jim: Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
Oscar: Try another sentence.
Jim: This rundown better be really good'?
Oscar: I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Jim: Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Oscar: Why don't you just ask him--
Jim: No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Oscar: What have you been doing?
Kevin: Try it in another sentence.
Ryan: Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
Michael: That's my corner.
Pam: I thought that was your corner.
Michael: No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Pam: So my corner's the one with the copier?
Michael: Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
Ryan: Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Charles: You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Jim: Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
Charles: Oh.
Jim: I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Charles: Okay, great.
Jim: Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Charles: Just keep it simple.
Jim: Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Charles: You're working hard? On this?
Jim: No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Charles: Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Jim: No, I....
Erin: Can I help you?
Pam: No thanks.
Jim: Hey!
Pam: Hey I'm here to see Charles.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Hey Charles.
Charles: Hey Pam.
Pam: I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
Charles: I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Pam: Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Charles: Um.
Pam: Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Charles: Yeah I know.
Pam: Personal shopper?
Charles: No.
Pam: Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
Charles: Okay.
Pam: I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Michael: Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Stanley: I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
Phyllis: It's really cute.
Michael: Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.
Stanley: She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Michael: What for?
Stanley: I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
Ryan: Are we staying til five?
Michael: Yes.
Michael: Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
Michael: Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Ryan: I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Michael: Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Michael: Hey Pam.
Pam: Hey.
Michael: You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Pam: Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Michael: Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
Jim: There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Charles: Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Jim: Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Charles: Do I need to?
Jim: No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Charles: What's that?
Jim: The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
Jim: Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Pam: We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
Man: Do you have a card?
Pam: Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Creed: These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Michael: These are shaped like paper.
Creed: Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Meredith: I'll take them for my kid.
Erin: Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Dwight: You're good.
Erin: Thank you.
Andy: That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
Erin: Wow!
Andy: What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
Dwight: Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
Andy: Really?
Dwight: Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Dwight and Erin: West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes]
Dwight: In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
Dwight and Andy: Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves]
Dwight: Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Toby: You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
Michael: I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
Pam: Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
Ryan: Keep going. [Whispers]
Michael: Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
Pam: We already offered free delivery!
Michael: They don't know that!
Pam: Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
Ryan: Write it down.
Michael: Give him a guarantee.
Pam: A guarantee of what?
Michael: Just say the word.
Pam: And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Michael: Yes!
Pam: I made a sale!
Ryan: Oh!
Michael: You did!
Pam: Oh!
Michael: Oh yeah!
Ryan: We did it !
Michael: She did it!
Michael: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]
Michael: Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.
Andy: Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Dwight: Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Andy: Better a cappella!
Dwight: No! Really?
Andy: Yeah. Name another.
Dwight: Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Andy: Better a cappella.
Dwight: Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
Andy: Aw!! Way better a cappella
Dwight: Really?
Andy: Yeah.
Michael: Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth]
Pam: Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Michael: Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]
Pam: We're getting pretty good at it.
Jim: Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
Pam: The timeline's messy.
Jim: Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
Andy: This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
Pam: I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
Andy: Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Jim: I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
Andy: Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
Pam: I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Andy: Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Phyllis: What's wrong with you?
Dwight: These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Phyllis: I think you look nice.
Dwight: Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
Charles: Looking good.
Dwight: Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
Dwight: When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Michael: Hey.
Dwight: Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Michael: [gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?
Dwight: They have some great kitchen ideas.
Michael: Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
Dwight: It's small, I know.
Michael: I really appreciate it.
Dwight: Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Michael: It's for your trouble.
Dwight: Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Michael: No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Dwight: Michael, you know I can't take this.
Michael: Yes, I do.
Dwight: But don't forget you owe me $10.
Michael: That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Dwight: Michael.
Andy: What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Jim: I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Andy: It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
Jim: Am I going down a road?
Andy: When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
Jim: It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Andy: I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
Jim: I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Michael: Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
Pam: I'm not gonna do that.
Michael: That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Ryan: I can get there.
Michael: Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Ryan: Oh, awesome.
Michael: Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]
Michael, Pam & Ryan: U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!
Pam: I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
Dwight: You needed to speak to me?
Charles: Dwight, take a seat.
Dwight: I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Charles: Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
Dwight: Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Charles: I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Dwight: Your concern is noted.
Charles: Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
Dwight: Like a wolf. Thank you.
Charles: And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
Dwight: Really?
Charles: Definitely.
Dwight: [sighs] It's firm.
Michael: [on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight: I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
Michael: Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
Dwight: No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Michael: I'm not following you.
Dwight: Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Michael: Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
Dwight: Good, do you see what I'm saying?
Michael: Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Dwight: No.
Michael: Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!']
Dwight: No.
Michael: [Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
Dwight: It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Michael: Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Dwight: It is the situation that we are in now.
Michael: So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Dwight: I'm not a barbarian.
Michael: Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight: I will.
Michael: Dwight?
Dwight: Yes?
Michael: Is the cool new guy Charles?
Dwight: I've said too much.
Michael: Is it Stanley?
Jim: Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
Andy: Noishe.'
Jim: -I just don't know if I can do it.
Andy: That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
Jim: It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
Andy: And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?
Jim: [both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Andy: [fist pound each other] Totally.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
Dwight: I'm sorry, Michael
Charles: [Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
Michael: Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Charles: No, Mich-Michael.
Michael: Dwight, run!
Charles: Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
Michael: You be cool.
Charles: Yes.
Michael: Just-what's going on?
Charles: We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Michael: Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Charles: He did.
Dwight: I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
Charles: Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Michael: I. Understand. Nothing.
Michael: [Michael storms into office] Wow.
Pam: Michael, are you alright?
Michael: It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Pam: Tell us what you're talking about.
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
Pam: We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Michael: I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
Andy: Hey, Jim.
Jim: [Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Andy: Bro, I do that all the time.
Jim: Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Andy: Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Jim: Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Andy: Well, so what?  Your body's a ten.
Jim: Forget it.
Andy: Jim.
Jim: I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
Dwight: [on phone] Dwight Schrute.
Michael: Hello, traitor.
Dwight: I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Michael: I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
Pam: Michael!
Michael: I'm just getting hardcore with him.
Ryan: Finally.
Michael: Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
Dwight: [on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?
Secretary: He's in a meeting.
Dwight: Dammit! [hangs up]
Michael: [on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?
Automated phone voice: If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first. [Michael sighs, hangs up phone]
Stanley: So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
Dwight: I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
Phyllis: You sound worried.
Dwight: And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Michael: [on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Ryan: Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Pam: I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Michael: Wow. High score?
Dwight: And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Dwight: Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
Michael: Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
Dwight: I would like to arrange a truce.
Michael: So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
Dwight: Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Michael: No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Dwight: In which direction?
Michael: Toward the sun.
Dwight: At what time?
Michael: Noon.
Dwight: That-
Michael: You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
Dwight: [looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
Michael: Dwight.
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
Dwight: You were making me do things that were not all right.
Michael: So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
Dwight: And not come through for you?
Michael: If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
Dwight: I want a truce.
Michael: I do too.
Dwight: Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Michael: Cooper's.
Dwight: I had fish yesterday.
Michael: Damn it.
Michael: [Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Dwight: Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Michael: Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
Dwight: I hit a bear.
Michael: What?
Dwight: He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Michael: Yeah, sure.
Dwight: Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
Michael: Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
Pam: [Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
Ryan: We can spend a couple days there.
Pam: Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Michael: [Michael answers phone] Yeah.
Dwight: Did you enjoy your lunch?
Michael: Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
Dwight: No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Michael: No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying 'Dwight did it!!'] You?
Dwight: Me.
Michael: What about our truce?
Dwight: I broke it.
Michael: On purpose?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: Why?
Dwight: You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Michael: Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Dwight: And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Michael: Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!
Dwight: Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
Dwight: [holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
Dwight: And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Michael: Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
Dwight: Sure. That'd be fine.
Michael: If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Dwight: This is war and that is what happens.
Michael: Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Dwight: Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
Michael: Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
Dwight: Michael! Michael!
Michael: You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Secretary: Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
Michael: Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Dwight: Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Michael: Walking in the door...
Mr. Schofield: Michael, good to see you.
Michael: Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
Michael: [on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Mr. Schofield: Really?
Michael: Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Dwight: Are you saying you invented paper?
Andy: [hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.
Jim: Oh, God.
Andy: Okay, Tuna.
Kelly: Hey, guys.
Jim: Hey.
Andy: Hello.
Andy: Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
Kevin: I guess I could be nicer.
Phyllis: Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Andy: Oh, really?
Phyllis: Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Jim: Okay.
Andy: Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
Jim: Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Andy: Uh, that's not what was-
Jim: And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Andy: Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
Michael: What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
Dwight: It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
Secretary: Uh, hello, Dwight.
Dwight: Spin move.
Secretary: Oh-
Dwight: Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Mr. Schofield: Dwight, I'm in a meeting.
Michael: That's very rude.
Dwight: I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Mr. Schofield: Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
Dwight: La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Michael: I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
Dwight: Come on.
Michael: Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
Dwight: What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Mr. Schofield: Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
Michael: That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Mr. Schofield: Uh, ok, sure.
Michael: Good, good, good. I will see you.
Dwight: Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
Mr. Schofield: Excuse me?
Michael: I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'
Dwight: How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
Michael: I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
Michael: He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Michael: Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
Ryan: Uncle Dave?
Michael: He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
Ryan: That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Pam: When are you ever responsible for your actions?
Ryan: Get off my ass, you hag.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
Michael: Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.
Andy: Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
Pam: It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
Andy: Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
Jim: When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Andy: Yes!
Pam: I don't think so, Andy.
Jim: Sorry. Her day.
Andy: Hey, bud.
Jim: Are they looking at me?
Andy: Who?
Jim: Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Andy: Are you sure?
Jim: Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Michael: Buenos dias, Erin.
Erin: Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Michael: No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
Michael: I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Michael: Buenos dias, Jaime.
Jim: Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
Michael: Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
Dwight: Guten tag, Herr Michael.
Dwight: I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
Michael: La telefona.
Oscar: El telefono.
Oscar: Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Oscar: Your office is full of genitalia.
Michael: [clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Oscar: That's what he says?'
Michael: Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.
Angela: Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
Michael: Yo soy Cancun.
Angela: [removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
Jim: All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Pam: You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
Jim: Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Michael: Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
Dwight: You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
Michael: I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Dwight: If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Jim: [whispers] That's a good point.
Pam: This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
Jim: Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Pam: We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
Jim: [whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Pam: [vaudeville delivery] Yee.
Donna: Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.
Jim: Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
Donna: Hi!
Jim: How are you?
Michael: Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Donna: [laughing] Oh, stop that.
Michael: Hi. How are you?
Michael: There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
Michael: Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
Donna: You look exactly alike.
Pam: Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
Donna: I have a sense about these things.
Jim: All right.
Donna: You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
Angela: I knew it. You should see their baby.
Jim: [explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Michael: [barges in] Hi.
Jim: Hold on one second.
Michael: Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
Jim: What?
Michael: Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Jim: None of this is time sensitive.
Michael: Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
Donna: Oh, yeah, thank you.
Michael: Okay, I have more of them.
Gabe: You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
Darryl: Sounds all right.
Dwight: What is this?
Gabe: Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
Dwight: It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
Darryl: I didn't say 'a'ight.'
Dwight: How do I apply?
Gabe: You have to be a minority.
Dwight: Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
Gabe: Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
Dwight: Come here. Come here.
Gabe: Hmm?
Dwight: Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
Gabe: Well...
Darryl: I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Dwight: One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
Kelly: [on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
Dwight: Oh, man. White people, right?
Kelly: I don't know if she was white.
Dwight: Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
Kelly: Yeah.
Dwight: I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Kelly: Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
Dwight: I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Kelly: Never thought of myself as an executive before.
Dwight: I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Kelly: I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
Dwight: You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
Kelly: I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
Dwight: That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Michael: I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
Donna: Mm-hmm.
Michael: And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.
Donna: Yeah.
Michael: It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
Michael: This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
Donna: Who took the photo?
Michael: Ryan.
Donna: Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
Michael: And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
Donna: [giggles] Not bad.
Michael: Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.
Donna: Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Michael: Hmm.
Donna: Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Michael: Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
Michael: [in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
Jim: No.
Pam: I'll have one.
Jim: Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Michael: Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
Jim: Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
Pam: Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
Donna: Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
Michael: Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
Pam: What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Jim: What?
Jim: What was that?
Pam: Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Jim: Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Pam: Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
Jim: Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Pam: Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
Dwight: How as being a minority affected you?
Kelly: Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Dwight: Oh, good, and you resent this because...
Kelly: Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Dwight: Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Kelly: Just put it in your pocket.
Michael and Donna: [indistinct chatter inside conference room]
Kevin: [looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Phyllis: You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
Creed: You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
Phyllis: She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Pam: Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
Kevin: [tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
Donna: Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
Jim: Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
Donna: Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
Jim: Yeah. [chuckles]
Michael: So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
Jim: What's that?
Michael: Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
Jim: I don't... I don't think so.
Michael: I think we could. [Donna giggles]
Oscar: I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Michael: Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
Oscar: Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
Michael: Why don't you run them again?
Jim: What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Michael: If she is, it's working.
Kevin: Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Jim: She does not like him.
Pam: You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Jim: cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Pam: I was after your money.
Jim: Well, the joke was on you.
Pam: Yes, it was.
Kelly: [typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
Ryan: Okay...
Dwight: Hey... what are you guys doing?
Kelly: This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
Ryan: Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Kelly: Oh, that is so good.
Dwight: You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
Kelly: Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
Dwight: Ryan? What does he know?
Ryan: It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
Kelly: Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
Dwight: We?'
Kelly: When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
Ryan: And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Dwight: Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
Michael: So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
Donna: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
Donna: Yes.
Michael: I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
Donna: Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
Michael: They're good [Donna grabs mint]
Donna: You want one?
Michael: Sure.
Donna: It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
Michael: I can't stop myself from kissing her.
Kevin: Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
Andy: Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
Kevin: Well, why don't you shut up!
Michael: Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
Jim: It is totally insane.
Oscar: Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
Michael: Okay. What do you think?
Kevin: I think it's over, man.
Michael: Andy?
Andy: Ehh.
Michael: Okay, some for, some against.
Jim: Nobody's for.
Michael: Pam?
Pam: Hmm?
Mihael: What do you think?
Pam: Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
Jim: What?
Pam: I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Michael: I'm going with Pam's group.
Jim: Wait.
Michael: Here we go.
Jim: Michael. Michael.
Michael: Okay.
Jim: Michael.
Michael: No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
Jim: No.
Michael: What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
Dwight: Kelly is disqualified!
Gabe: What?
Dwight: You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Gabe: Yeah, but she's not white, though.
Dwight: Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
Gabe: Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
Darryl: I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Dwight: Kelly is the only applicant.
Gabe: Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
Kelly: Namaste.
Dwight: Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
Kelly: Hello.
Gabe: That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
Kelly: Sometimes my bangs cover it.
Gabe: Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
Kelly: I do find that offensive, actually.
Michael: We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Donna: Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
Michael: Okay.
Donna: And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
Michael: Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
Donna: Thank you. Did I... get everything?
Michael: I don't know. I think so.
Donna: Yeah, I think so.
Michael: [whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
Donna: Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
Donna: No, it's just in the lot, so...
Michael: Thank you so much.
Donna: You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.
Michael: Mmm. [Donna giggles]
Donna: Bye.
Michael: [follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
Donna: I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
Michael: All right. All right. Bye.
Donna: Bye-bye!
Michael: And have a good elevator ride.
Donna: Okay.
Michael: Oh, what's that out there?
Kevin: Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Dwight: How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Erin: Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Dwight: I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
Erin: I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Dwight: What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Stanley: Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
Dwight: Yes.
Stanley: I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
Erin: Mm!
Dwight: Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Oscar: Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Dwight: I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
Kelly: For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
Dwight: Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Kelly: Dwight: What are you doing?
Dwight: Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Kelly: God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Dwight: Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
Hide: Why? I don't need translator.
Dwight: You don't know what you need. Just...
Gabe: Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
Hide: In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand.
Pam: Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
Michael: I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
Pam: You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Michael: She suckered you too.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Was it the cleavage?
Pam: Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
Michael: Yep.
Phyllis: Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
Andy: You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
Erin: Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Michael: God. She left this here?
Erin: Yeah.
Michael: Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
Jim: What?
All: No.
Michael: Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
Oscar: It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
Pam: Michael...
Michael: [hold up barrette] Well...
Pam: She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
Michael: Yeah, I know. I know.
Pam: I'm sorry.
Michael: I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]
Pam: Michael! [sighs]
Michael: [runs down to parking lot, sighs]
Donna: [still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
Michael: Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
Gabe: Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
Gabe: They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
Kelly: [puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Erin: Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Kelly: Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Erin: Great.
Dwight: Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
Kelly: Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: Oh.
Kelly: I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Dwight: Gosh. He he.
Kelly: Because I never forget anything.
Dwight: Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
Michael: You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
Donna: No, y-you were... right.
Michael: Who?
Donna: You were right.
Michael: About what?
Donna: You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
Michael: No, no. No.
Donna: I'm sor...
Michael: No... [they kiss again]
Michael: [returns to office] What happened?
Erin: Kelly got into the minority training program.
Michael: Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.
Kevin: Ooh.
Phyllis: Oh, Michael.
Michael: No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
Michael: You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
Dwight: Stop it!
Jim: Stop what?
Dwight: You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
Jim: [chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
Jim: Yup. That's exactly what we did.
Pam: It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
Dwight: Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Michael: Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
Jim: It's a pen.
Dwight: Michael, come on.
Michael: Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
Dwight: Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Michael: Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
Michael: Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
Stanley: I have an idea for your weekend.
Michael: Okay.
Stanley: Let me get back to my desk right now.
Michael: Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Pam: Stanley got to go.
Michael: Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
Andy: Walk around apple orchards.
Michael: Oh!
Andy: Super romantic.
Michael: That's fun.
Dwight: Eel fishing.
Michael: All right.
Darryl: Curl up with your favorite DVD.
Meredith: You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
Michael: We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
Kelly: Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Michael: Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
Kelly: Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Michael: You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
Ryan: Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
Michael: You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
Pam: No, Michael, no.
Dwight: Are you nuts?
Pam: You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
Michael: ... and... we had sex, too.
Pam: That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Michael: How?
Pam: How what?
Michael: How do I not make any more of it?
Pam: You could start by concluding this meeting.
Michael: All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'
Dwight: Oh, no.
Andy: How many dates have you been on?
Michael: Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Andy: Mm.
Oscar: That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
Ryan: Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Ryan: Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Michael: Yeah, she does all that.
Ryan: Sorry, dude.
Michael: No, no...
Pam: Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Michael: Run what?
Pam: Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Michael: Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
Pam: Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
Michael: Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
Jim: You do?
Michael: Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
Jim: But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Michael: That's what makes it so wrong.
Michael: Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
Dwight: Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
Michael: [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
Dwight: I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
Michael: This is you. How much do you charge?
Dwight: $100 a day, plus expenses.
Michael: I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
Dwight: I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
Andy: Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
Stanley: My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Andy: Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
Gabe: There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
Andy: Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
Gabe: That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
Andy: What are we gonna do about this?
Gabe: I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
Andy: Let me know what they say.
Darryl: [puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
Andy: What do you mean?
Darryl: You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
Andy: I don't know.
Darryl: Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
Darryl: Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Dwight: [sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
Donna: Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
Dwight: I work with Michael.
Donna: Right.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]
Donna: Donna, hi.
Dwight: All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
Jim: That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Michael: It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
Pam: Oh!...
Jim: Oh, my God
Michael: It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.
Jim: You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Michael: I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Pam: Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
Michael: Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
Jim: Michael, no...
Pam: No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
Michael: It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
Pam: Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Michael: God, this is so disgusting.
Pam: Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
Michael: I know.
Pam: And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Michael: That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
Pam: Helene.
Michael: Helene?
Pam: My mother.
Michael: Oh.
Pam: My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]
Michael: Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
Jim: You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
Michael: [sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]
Dwight: [at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
Donna: Thank you.
Dwight: It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
Donna: You okay?
Dwight: Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Donna: [chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
Dwight: Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
Dwight: [moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
Donna: Nope. I'm good, thanks.
Dwight: Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
Old lady: Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?
Dwight: Get out of my way. Huh!
Dwight: Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
Donna: I'm out of here.
Dwight: Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
Donna: You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
Dwight: Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
Michael: You're back. What happened?
Dwight: Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Michael: No, what happened with Donna?
Dwight: Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
Michael: Ugh!
Dwight: Put your fingers here.
Michael: No. No! Are you sure?
Dwight: I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
Michael: Who eats eight protein bars?
Dwight: People who don't trust egg whites.
Michael: Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
Dwight: Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
Michael: What? No, she didn't say that.
Dwight: You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
Michael: I am not paying for that membership.
Michael: [sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...
Erin: Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Michael: No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
Erin: Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Michael: That's her?
Erin: Yeah.
Michael: Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Donna: How could you think I would cheat on you?
Michael: I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Donna: That's pathetic.
Michael: Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
Donna: When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
Michael: If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
Donna: I told you I like you.
Michael: Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]
Donna: Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
Michael: ...poop my pants.
Donna: Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
Michael: Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
Donna: We're going.
Michael: We are?
Donna: Yeah.
Andy: What's up? I got your e-mail.
Darryl: Close the door.
Andy: Okay.
Darryl: I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
Darryl: Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Andy: Such as?
Darryl: It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Andy: What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?'
Darryl: Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
Andy: [chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
Kelly: Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
Donna: Thank you.
Kelly: Did Michael get them for you?
Donna: No, I bought them myself.
Kelly: Where?
Donna: Steamtown Mall.
Kelly: Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
Donna: You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
Kelly: Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Donna: Uh, Franklin Mills.
Jim: [to Pam] What?
Pam: Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
Pam: Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
Jim: Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
Pam: No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Creed: Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
Andy: Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Creed: So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
Pam: So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
Donna: Isn't that something?
Michael: Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.
Pam: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Hey.
Pam: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
Michael: Well it can wait. It can wait.
Pam: I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
Michael: Jim is her husband.
Donna: Oh.
Pam: And...
Michael: And they are having problems, so sh...
Pam: No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Michael: Good in bed.
Pam: Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
Michael: Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
Pam: [loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
Michael: Okay, weirdo.
Pam: I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
Donna: Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
Pam: [to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
Donna: I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
Michael: Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Pam: Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office]
Darryl: Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Glen: I know, it's just, I'm scared...
Andy: Your text said 911.
Darryl: Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
Darryl: It's bad.
Andy: What's bad?
Darryl: It's real bad.
Darryl: Still no plan.
Andy: Oh, God.
Darryl: It's getting bigger.
Andy: I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
Darryl: I can videotape it.
Andy: Yeah.
Darryl: [to camera] There it is.
Andy: There what is?
Darryl: What?
Michael: Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
Pam: I don't know who he is.
Michael: God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
Pam: What?
Michael: I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
Pam: You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
Michael: I have to hear it from her.
Pam: You have to settle down first.
Michael: I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
Pam: Okay. Okay. Yes.
Michael: I need to have her say...
Pam: Yeah, but you have to calm...
Michael: I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'
Pam: Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Michael: No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
Pam: [in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
Michael: [calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.
Gabe: [to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
Michael: You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
Donna: Yeah, we should.
Michael: Wouldn't that be fun?
Donna: Yeah.
Michael: How about Thursday?
Donna: Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
Michael: I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Donna: Oh, Friday doesn't work.
Michael: Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
Donna: Shoot. I'm working.
Michael: Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
Donna: Well, won't you be at the concert?
Michael: Nope, that's Tuesday.
Donna: Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
Michael: You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
Donna: How do you know?
Michael: Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]
Pam: [gasps] Did she see me?
Jim: [to Pam on floor] Nice effort.
Andy: [in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
Darryl: You haven't even introduced yourself.
Andy: Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
Darryl: You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Andy: Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
Darryl: Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Andy: Make it higher? Okay.
Darryl: Mm-hmm
Andy: [high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
Darryl: One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Andy: [higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!
Darryl: This... [removes camera headset]
Andy: We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
Darryl: I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
Michael: Who is he?
Donna: What, what do you mean?
Michael: The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
Donna: It's you. I'm married.
Michael: I'm the mistress?
Dwight: [on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
Gym Instructor: Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this.
Dwight: You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
Gym instructor: Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill.
Dwight: No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Gym instructor: No, guys, no. We're just cooling down...
Dwight: If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Michael: [sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
Dwight: [walking up] Michael?
Michael: Yes?
Dwight: I've got a treat for you!
Michael: Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
Dwight: Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
Michael: [Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Dwight: [angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
Michael: Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
Dwight: What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Michael: I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Dwight: Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Michael: Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
Dwight: Great idea.
Michael: ...in order to feed the bears.
Dwight: Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Michael: How do you mean?
Dwight: Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Michael: Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Dwight: Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Michael: Okay.
DeAngelo: [with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
Michael: Hm?
DeAngelo: I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
Michael: Well I have interviews.
DeAngelo: That's nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?
Michael: Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
DeAngelo: You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
Michael: Oh you don't, that's-
DeAngelo: I will be in the break room.
Michael: That sounds good. Thank you.
DeAngelo: Dead man walking.
Michael: Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
Gabe: [sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Andy: Hey!
Gabe: I'm your boss!
Andy: Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
Gabe: No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Andy: Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
Gabe: No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
Andy: [weak] Hi Tuna.
Jim: So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Phyllis: [in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
Angela: Please.
Pam: What's wrong with cupcakes?
Angela: Everything.
Michael: [walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Pam: Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
Pam: We thought.
Angela: It's an experiment.
Phyllis: The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Pam: So this is the dream team.
Meredith: [walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
Angela: The dream team... and Meredith.
Meredith: [to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Michael: Mmm!
Phyllis: Yeah that was a surprise...
Michael: You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
Pam: [surprised] Okay.
Michael: Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
Pam: Should we get toppings?
Michael: What do you like Pam?
Pam: [confused] What?
Michael: What kind of toppings would you like?
Pam: Hot fudge?
Michael: Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]
Michael: [holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
Michael: [pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
Phyllis: Please Michael.
Michael: When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.
Phyllis: I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Phyllis: [holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Michael: Ahh.
Phyllis: It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Michael: [hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
Phyllis: It's cute. [plays with it]
Michael: Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
Stanley: Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
Michael: Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
Andy: Wow.
Stanley: [angry] Yeah wow!
Andy: You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
Michael: But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
Phyllis: What does that even mean?
Michael: You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
Andy: I'm gonna lose 'em.
Michael: You're not gonna lose them.
Andy: I promise you that I will.
Michael: Just do your best! I have faith in you.
Stanley: [as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Andy: No.
Phyllis: [to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
Dwight: I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
DeAngelo: I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]
Michael: Kevin, I have something for you.
Kevin: Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Michael: You know who that is?
Kevin: Oh...
Michael: [rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Kevin: Better...
Michael: Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
Kevin: But...
Michael: You will find love.
Kevin: Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
Michael: Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
Andy: I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
Michael: [quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]
Oscar: Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
Michael: [laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
Michael: Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
Angela: It was just you...
Michael: How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
Oscar: State Senator.
Michael: Mmhmm, bravo!
Oscar: Brava!
Angela: You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Michael: Sure!
Angela: Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Michael: Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
Angela: Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
Michael: I guess this could be the one, huh?
Angela: Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
Andy: [walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
DeAngelo: [hurriedly, while hiding the chocolate covered chicken] Hey!
Andy: I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
DeAngelo: Let's rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline]
Gabe: [Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
Oscar: [Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Michael: My last pay check?
Oscar: You have an address yet in Colorado?
Michael: No.
Oscar: What town do Holly's parents live in?
Michael: I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
Kevin: Sounds beautiful!
Pam: [Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
Kevin: I'm going to!
Jim: [to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Michael: Nah, I'm almost done.
Jim: You sure?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
Kevin: Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Pam: It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
Kevin: Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
Pam: It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
Kevin: I know...
Jim: Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Kevin: No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Pam: I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
Michael: [crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone]
Holly: [on phone] Hello there!
Michael: Hi. What is the name of our town?
Holly: Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
Michael: No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
Holly: [Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
Michael: [laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
Holly: [deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
Michael: [laughing] Ohh, I miss you.
Holly: Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Michael: Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
Holly: I love you too.
Michael: [hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
Toby: Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
Michael: [grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.
Toby: [smiling] Okay.
Michael: [walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
Kelly: [doing make up and irritated] What?!
Michael: If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
Kelly: Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Michael: [in Ryan's office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
Ryan: Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: This is... totally unnecessary.
Michael: You're not prone to seizures?
Ryan: No.
Pam: [in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
Meredith: [quickly] Erotic.
Angela: See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Phyllis: Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
Meredith: I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
Angela: Good God...
Meredith: They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Pam: I don't, I don't think we sh-
Meredith: I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Pam: [stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
Phyllis: As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Pam: You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Kelly: I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
Phyllis: Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
Angela: No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Michael: [sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
Pam: Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
Michael: [disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused]
Erin: [walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Gabe: I need to talk to you!
Erin: You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
abe: Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Erin: Hey Creed.
Creed: Not cool man. [walks out]
Erin: I really think you should leave.
Gabe: Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
Erin: Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Gabe: Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
Erin: Gabe!
Gabe: Okay... [walks out embarrassed]
Toby: [on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
Rory: I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him.
Toby: Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
Rory: Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.
Toby: Well, no. He hates jams.
Michael: [walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!
Darryl: Hey.
Michael: I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
Darryl: That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
Michael: Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
Darryl: No. Can't let you do that Mike.
Michael: No problem. Worth a try.
Michael: [in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
Warehouse Guy: No.
Michael: [picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]
DeAngelo: [in car with Andy] okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?
Andy: I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
DeAngelo: That's stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]
Andy: [joking] What do I know?
DeAngelo: [still laughing] What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
Andy: [confused] Yeah.
DeAngelo: Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
Andy: Yeah!
DeAngelo: Cause if you do now's the time.
Andy: [going for it] Alright.
DeAngelo: Not while I'm driving.
Michael: [still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]
DeAngelo: [at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
Andy: No. I don't.
DeAngelo: [hands Andy a dog] I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.
Andy: Awwhh, wow.
DeAngelo: Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.
Andy: Oh, okay...
DeAngelo: Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?
Andy: Mmhmmm.
DeAgnelo: Wooo! Yeah! [parades in circles with the dog, pretends to whack Andy with it] [giving it to Andy] Okay, again.
Erin: I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Michael: Kevin?
Erin: Andy.
Michael: Ahhhh...
Erin: I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Michael: Maybe neither.
Erin: I'm not attracted to Kevin.
Michael: Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
Erin: [nods] Extension 147.
Michael: N-
Erin: I know.
Michael: Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
Phyllis: [on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Michael: Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
Phyllis: No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
Michael: Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Phyllis: Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Michael: Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
Dwight: This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
Dwight: [opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
Michael: [in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
DeAngelo: [giving his and Andy's pitch to a client] I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. [Andy looks awkward] But I can say this: He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say: go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy. [Andy deflates] You ever play Russian Roulette? [scoffs] Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year. [hands the client a folder he needs signed for another year's contract]
Jim: [Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Michael: You should see the other guy.
Dwight: [smiles knowingly]
Michael: [looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?
Jim: Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Michael: But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Pam: [walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
Michael: [in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
Michael: Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
Michael: [Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.
Gabe: [sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
Michael: No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
DeAngelo: [walking out the client's room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
Andy: Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
DeAngelo: [grumbles] Okay whatever.
Andy: [walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
Client: Keep talking.
DeAngelo: [on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You'll never guess, we did it!
Andy: [laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
DeAngelo: We did it!
Michael: [standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
Stanley: Yes, what is this about?
Michael: What is this meeting about?
Stanley: Mmhmmm.
Michael: Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
Phyllis: They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Michael: [cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Stanley: Is that it?
Michael: Umm, hmm?
Stanley: Is that it?
Michael: [the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
Jim: Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Michael: Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!
Jim: [brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Michael: [sad] Ohh...
Jim: What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Michael: [holding back tears] Okay...
Jim: You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Michael: Maybe.
Jim: Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Michael: Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
Jim: Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Michael: [pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
Jim: You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jim: And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Michael: [hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Jim: Alright.
Michael: Alright.
Jim: Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Michael: I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
Jim: [shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
Michael: I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Jim: [chuckles] You got it.
Michael: Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.
Phyllis: Oh no, they're still not done.
Michael: No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
Creed: [drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Michael: Later guys. [leaves the office]
Michael: Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
Michael: [putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
Pam: [watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
DeAngelo: [all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no]
Dwight: [to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]
Deangelo: So, coasting time is officially over.  Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast.  If you don't like 'em, this is called a door.  You can walk right through it.  Alright.  I'm not here to be your friend.  I like my life outside of this place.  I live to leave at 5.  Change number one: Darryl.  Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night.  Full ride.  Deal with it.
Darryl: Seriously?
Deangelo: Stone cold seriously.
Deangelo: They are trying to figure me out.  And I don't like it.  Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear.  And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader.  Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care.
Deangelo: Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair.
Toby: Thanks.
Deangelo: Don't thank me!  Hey, don't thank me, guy!  Okay?  And I don't care if you like it.
Oscar: These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Deangelo: I don't care what your favorite flavor is.  Here's a bowl of ice cream.  You either like it or you don't.  [Andy nods] That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays.  Alright?  Clear?  Any questions?
Kevin: This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
Deangelo: That is a s--  astute observation, Kevin.
Deangelo: Kev's got me pegged.  [chuckles]
Deangelo: It blows away Vermont in the fall.
Darryl: Snap, for real?
Pam: Good morning, Deangelo.
Deangelo: Hold on.
Pam: Okay.
Deangelo: [continuing to talk to Darryl] And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring.
Pam: Because of the flowers.
Deangelo: No.  Because the entire state smells like Earth.
Pam: Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
Deangelo: Yes, Pam.
Pam: Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Deangelo: Put it with the rest.
Pam: Okay.
Deangelo: [entering his office] Hey dudes!
Jim: Hey!
Andy: Hey!
Pam: Oh my God, he hates me!
Jim: No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Pam: I know.
Jim: Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
Pam: Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Jim: Careful.  There is no inner circle.
Andy: Oh, there's an inner circle.  Oh yeah.
Jim: There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Kevin: Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
Deangelo: [holding two cups of coffee] There he is!  Got ya coffee.  [offers cup to Dwight]
Dwight: Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
Deangelo: Not a coffee guy, I take it.
Dwight: It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Deangelo: Listen.  I've got a sixer.  'Automatic for the People' on the jukebox.  Let's hit the park after sundown.  Come on!  Pick up some sausage if you want.
Dwight: I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
Deangelo: No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me.  It reminds me of my relationship with my son.  Except there, I'm the Dwight.
Deangelo: Who's the biggest client in the state?  I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes.  Huh?  What do you guys say?
Kevin: Yes!
Deangelo: Right!  Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients.
Kevin: Yeah, I say we just go for it!
Deangelo: [shoots mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual?  Is that a Chinatown knockoff?
Jim: That's Toys R Us, I think.
Deangelo: No, that's definitely a knockoff.  You can feel the center of gravity's off.  Feel that.  [throws ball to Gabe]  What do you think?
Gabe: [holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Deangelo: [calling for the ball] Deangelo! [shoots and makes it]  See what I did there?  That's what you need to do.  [makes shooting gesture] It's that little English.  The British are coming.
Kevin: Yes.
Deangelo: Deangelo's open!
Deangelo: Hey Ry.  Your department's killing it, baby. [puts arm around Ryan]
Ryan: Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
Deangelo: Keep it up.
Ryan: The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
Kelly: What?
Ryan: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Kelly: Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Ryan: Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
Kelly: Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
Ryan: I'd die for you too.
Kelly: You really would?
Ryan: [hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
Kelly: Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
Deangelo: Woo.  Glad he's not my boss.
Ryan: [whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
Deangelo: You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name.  So I've never had to buy it.  True story.  I just drink my cousin's.
Dwight: Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
Deangelo: You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?
Dwight: I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
Deangelo: Ohhhh no.
Dwight: What?
Deangelo: Okay?  I'm gonna win you over.
Dwight: No you're not.
Deangelo: Yes I am.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Oh yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.  Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
Jim: [looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Darryl: The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
Deangelo: What's wrong with juggling, Darryl?  I'm a big juggler.  I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.
Jim: Seriously?
Deangelo: Oh yeah.  I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet?  320?
Gabe: 320.  Just freeballin' it.
Deangelo: It's a little cramped.  How many square feet out there?  17, 18 hundo?
Kevin: Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
Gabe: Give or take. [Deangelo walks out]
Deangelo: Sorry gang.  Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car.  It's not.
Pam: Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Andy: I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
Deangelo: Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments.  You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? [starts to play 'Wake Me Up Inside' by Evanescence] Prepare... to go into the danger zone.  [begins pretend juggling routine]
Pam: Oh wow, you weren't kidding.
Deangelo: No.  Never.  Can someone please throw me a fifth ball?  If you dare!  [Kevin pretends to throw ball]  Incoming!  And we're on!  Remember, nothing's impossible!  Phyllis, where's Phyllis?
Phyllis: [raises hand] Here.
Deangelo: Do you believe in me, Phyllis?
Phyllis: Yeah.
Deangelo: Because I believe in you.
Phyllis: Okay.
Deangelo: [pretending to bounce balls off Phyllis at close range]  Feel that connection?  Don't move your head.  Please.  Thank you.  Oh!  Big hand for Phyllis!  [clapping]  That took a lot of guts!  [finishes routine]  Ho!  I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.
Kevin: Didn't drop a single ball!
Pam: [imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
Jim: What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Pam: What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
Jim: He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Angela: Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.
Angela: Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Andy: How could I not see it?  You're so right.
Pam: [to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Jim: And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
Pam: Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Jim: Mmm-hmm.
Andy: And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
Jim: Hey, you got a second?
Deangelo: Yeah, I got tons of time.  This job's a joke.
Deangelo: So what's up?
Jim: Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Darryl: [opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
Deangelo: Yeah sure.  Let's make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office]
Jim: If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Deangelo: What's the big secret?  Why are you even whispering?  Come on, it's the guys!
Jim: I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Deangelo: Uh-oh.  Right?
Kevin: Hot!
Jim: Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
Darryl: Damn!
Jim: Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
Deangelo: Are you serious?  Who feels this way?
Jim: Oh.  Like nobody.
Gabe: Umm, Pam?
Jim: It was --
Gabe: Was it Pam?
Kevin: That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
Deangelo: Guys.  Hold on.  Doesn't matter who, okay?  I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea.
Jim: That's awesome.
Deangelo: Thank you.
Kelly: [on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
Ryan: [joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Kelly: When Deangelo's around.
Ryan: And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
Kelly: All the time.
Ryan: All the time.
Deangelo: Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?
Erin: Absolutely.
Jim: Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
Deangelo: Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim.  Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist.  I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not.  I am not a sexist.  Raise your hand if you have a vagina.  [Deangelo raises hand, Kelly and Pam sheepishly raise hands] Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina.  [Deangelo raises other hand, along with rest of office] Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Just about everyone.  What about Deangelo's hand?  Oh wow.  He's got 'em both up.  [Ryan raises both hands]  Yeah.  Uh huh.  [others raise both hands] Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men.  Okay?  Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.
Phyllis: I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Deangelo: Dwight, what's your take?
Dwight: What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Deangelo: Man, you're smart.  [Erin arrives with new executive assistant]  Oh, hey!  Hi!  Hello.  Welcome.  Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield.  This is everyone.
Jordan: Hello.
Pam: So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
Jordan: No, Anthropology.  We don't have this in that size, pretty lame.
Kelly: Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
Jordan: Yeah.
Kelly: That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
Jordan: Well, I umm -
Kelly: You chose this job over that job?
Ryan: Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Pam: So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Jordan: Yeah.
Deangelo: Yup.
Pam: Wow.
Deangelo: No corporate experience whatsoever.  I didn't want anyone with any bad habits.
Kevin: [heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?
Jim: Oh yeah, did he text us?
Kevin: Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Dwight: [holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Pam: Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
Jim: He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
Andy: Yes!  I'm in.
Angela: Andy, what are you doing?
Andy: I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
Pam: [to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
Deangelo: Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo's office and sits down] where do we get our paper from?  Do we go -
Jim: [to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Deangelo: [staring at Jim] Hey Jim.
Jim: Yeah.
Deangelo: Can I help you?
Jim: Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Dwight: So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Jim: Well, there is no inner...circle.
Jordan: Dwight?  Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
Dwight: Really?  Anything.
Jordan: Do you need anything?
Dwight: Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Andy: Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
Jim: So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
Pam: So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
Ryan: Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Deangelo: No one likes a money grubber.
Kelly: I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Deangelo: Ohh.
Ryan: Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
Kelly: No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Deangelo: Is this true, Ryan?
Ryan: I did not see Rango.
Deangelo: Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said.
Kelly: He's not saying anything!
Deangelo: It's too murky.  I like Ryan.  You seem kind of hysterical to me.  Ryan's your supervisor.  Let's just leave it that way.
Kelly: That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Ryan: [sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Pam: [knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Gabe: Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
Deangelo: [chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?
Gabe: [laughs] Total brain burp.
Deangelo: I'm no MJ.  I can do his dunk.  From the free throw line.
Kevin: Whoa.
Darryl: Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
Darryl: The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Pam: Okay, well it's just really loud.
Deangelo: Okay.  We'll keep that in mind.  Alright, ladies, back to the game.
Darryl: Do it!
Deangelo: Jim!  Come on in.
Pam: You're back in.
Jim: You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Deangelo: Yeah, we'll set that up one day.
Jim: Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Deangelo: Yeah, I don't know.
Jim: Why not?
Deangelo: Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs!  Okay?  Let's do it.
Dwight: Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Deangelo: Damn it, Dwight!  Enough!  Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out]
Dwight: Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Jim: Alright, there you go.
Deangelo: Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?
Jim: 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Deangelo: Nah, that's 15.  Yeah.
Jim: Okay.
Deangelo: And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?
Jordan: Seriously?
Deangelo: Yeah, come on.  I'll dunk over you.  Best seat in the house.
Jordan: I don't, I don't think I can do that.  I'm holding your jewelry.
Deangelo: Right.  Yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  Kevin, you do it.
Kevin: Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
Deangelo: Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap?  Angela?
Angela: No.
Deangelo: Oscar?
Oscar: No thank you.
Deangelo: Okay, Jimmy, this is for you.  Show you that anything is possible.
Jim: Fantastic.
Deangelo: Alright?
Jim: Yup.
Deangelo: This is also for the troops.  [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim]  Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo]
Jim: [ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Erin: [Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Deangelo: [speaking gibberish] Tablab.
Jim: Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Erin: Who should I say is calling?
Jim: Erin.
Deangelo: [lots of gibberish] says to bartender [lots more gibberish]  Droswip.  Droswip.
Gabe: Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
Phyllis: Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
Jim: Phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
Darryl: So how was the drive in?
Phyllis: Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Darryl: You don't say?
Phyllis: Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Phyllis: Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
Oscar: Yeah.
Phyllis: I actually sleep better when it's raining.
Meredith: Tell me about it.
Oscar: Time's almost up. How many are left?
Pam: Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
Darryl: Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Phyllis: What do you mean?
Pam: You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
Jim: Hey, come on.
Phyllis: Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Jim: And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
Phyllis: I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
Andy: [singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
Andy & Erin: Hey la, hey la...
Andy: ...my girlfriend's back!
Erin: [simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Andy: Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
Kevin: Welcome home.
Erin: Thank you.
Andy: Hey, Kev.
Kevin: Yeah.
Andy: Nice sweater.
Kevin: [wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Andy: What happened to old salty?
Dwight: Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Dwight: I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
Andy: Okey dokey. [knocks on door]
Nellie: Yes?
Andy: Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
Nellie: Oh yes.
Andy: I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Nellie: You are most welcome.
Andy: Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
Nellie: No.
Andy: Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
Nellie: Mm-hmm.
Andy: Get back to normalcy.
Nellie: Hmm, no.
Ravi: ...and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. [Pam, Jim and Kelly laugh] But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call.
Pam: Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
Jim: That's it.
Kelly: It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Pam: Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
Jim: Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Pam: Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
Pam: [talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
Kelly: [cries, slams fist on desk] Why?
Pam: [Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
Kevin: [Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
Ryan: Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Jim: Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
Ryan: Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Pam: Don't shake our baby?
Ryan: Yeah.
Pam: Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
Ryan: Oh, my God.
Pam: Yeah, I'm glad you said something.
Ryan: Me too.
Ryan: Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Ryan: Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Pam: Yeah, they're really great together.
Ryan: Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Jim: That's about it, yeah.
Robert: Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
Nellie: No.
Robert: I'm sorry?
Andy: This is what I was trying to tell you.
Robert: I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs]
Nellie: Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Robert: You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
Robert: I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
Nellie: I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Andy: [chuckling] Okay.
Nellie: Five... four...
Andy: You can't dock my pay-
Nellie: Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.
Angela: On it!
Andy: Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
Nellie: Do you want to go again?
Andy: Angela?
Nellie: Let's go again. Five... four...
Andy: Ooh, she's counting again.
Nellie: Three... two... one...
Andy: Oh, oh!
Nellie: Angela, two hundred dollars!
Angela: You got it.
Andy: Seriously, Angela?
Andy: I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Erin: When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Nellie: I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Andy: You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
Nellie: Three...
Andy: It's literally like-
Nellie: Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
Erin: There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Erin: Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Andy: Oh, yeah, I was just tired.
Erin: We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Andy: Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
Erin: Really. It's not a big deal.
Andy: Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
Ryan: I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Kelly: Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
Ryan: Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Kelly: God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Ryan: You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
Ryan: I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Erin: When you lost the manager job-
Dwight: Yes?
Erin: Did it affect you outside of the office?
Dwight: How?
Erin: I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Dwight: Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Erin: Oh, okay.
Dwight: Okay?
Erin: Okay.
Dwight: Washington Monument.
Erin: Oh.
Dwight: Eiffel Tower.
Erin: Okay, okay.
Pam: I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Kelly: He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
Pam: Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
Kelly: Which time?
Pam: I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Dwight: One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
Dwight: Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Dwight: Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
Nellie: What do you mean?
Dwight: Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
Nellie: I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
Nellie: Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
Andy: You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
Nellie: Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Andy: Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
Nellie: No.
Andy: Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Robert: Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is 'impotence.'
Nellie: Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
Nellie: Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
Nellie: This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
Dwight: It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Oscar: Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Nellie: Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Robert & Creed: [in unison] How old?
Creed: Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
Nellie: Dwight told me about it earlier.
Erin: Dwight!
All: What?
Erin: You promised!
Kevin: Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
Dwight: No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Angela: What are you doing?
Oscar: What is this?
Angela: Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
Andy: Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
Andy: I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Andy: Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
Jim: Um...
Darryl: Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
Robert: It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.
Andy: Fascinating.
Gabe: I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
Nellie: Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
Kevin: Tip-top shape.
Nellie: Oh... Stanley?
Stanley: No. Um-um.
Nellie: Creed, you are a thousand years old.
Creed: Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
Andy: Okay, so I-
Pam: Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
Jim: What happened?
Pam: That a couple of times-
Jim: Couple of times.
Robert: Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
Dwight: Yeah Jim.
Andy: Yeah Jim, get it out there.
Jim: Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Pam: Okay, stop.
Jim: I was very drunk.
Phyllis: If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Phyllis: Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
Gabe: I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
Angela: Ugh.
Gabe: This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
Robert: No, that's absolutely the case.
Gabe: I know, right?
Dwight: You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Robert: Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands]
Kevin: Ooh, ooh!
Jim: Wow, what are we talking about?
Erin: Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Toby: Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
Nellie: The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
Robert: I almost didn't come in today. [laughs]
Andy: [on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
Nellie: Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
Erin: Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
Andy: Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
Erin: And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
Andy: Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
Nellie: Okay, just calm down.
Andy: You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
Robert: Andy, why don't you just take a seat?
Andy: Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
Erin: And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
Andy: And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
Darryl: He does not like that wall.
Erin: Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Andy: That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
Robert: Andy, Erin, you can join us now.
Ryan: Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
Pam: All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Ryan: Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Pam: Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
Ryan: Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
Oscar: Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Ryan: For Kelly?
Kevin: Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
Nate: I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
Ryan: Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
Pam: Oh, no, no, no.
Oscar: Oh, come on.
Pam: Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
Ryan: No. It would cause me too much pain.
Pam: Read through the pain. Be strong.
Ryan: This poem would crush you!
Oscar: Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Kevin: Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
Ryan: You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Kelly: Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Robert: Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles]
Andy: No.
Robert: Excuse me?
Andy: I'm saying no.
Robert: Well you can't say no.
Andy: No.
Pam: [sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
Ryan: You are toxic! You are toxic!
Pam: Boo!
Jim: Hey, hey. Okay.
Ryan: Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Kelly: I wasn't going to interrupt.
Ryan: Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Pam: Barf! Ugh, you suck!
Ryan: What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Wrangler: Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!
Ryan: Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Wrangler: She don't wanna turn around.
Ryan: Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Kelly: Ryan.
Ryan: Will you roll those dice with me?
Kelly: You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
Ryan: No you don't.
Kelly: I do.
Ryan: No you don't.
Kelly: I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Ryan: What? [they hug]
Kelly: That was really cool. [they make out]
Angela: Ugh. Eww!
Jim: Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
Angela: Oh God!
Robert: Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.
Andy: No.
Nellie: It's the apology. I really have to insist.
Andy: [British accent] No.
Nellie: Stop saying no.
Andy: No.
Robert: Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
Andy: No.
Andy: I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
Erin: Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding]
Andy: Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
Erin: But you hurt your hand.
Andy: I... Got... It.
Erin: Right now?
Andy: Yes.
Pam: You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Jim: Not at all, can we go?
Pam: Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.'
Jim: Second line.
Pam: He is a drifter out to sea.'
Jim: And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Pam: It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Jim: Uh, Ryan can never know.
Ryan: [pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Pam: Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
Ryan: Smokey's dead.
Pam: Smokey, the bear?
Ryan: Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
Jim: Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
Ryan: Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Jim: Well, I second that emotion.
Ryan: Huh?
Nellie: I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Ryan: Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
Nellie: Yeah
Ryan: Um... God, so many, Nellie!
Pam: No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
Ryan: Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
Pam: I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Ryan: Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
Dwight: You don't like the Beatles?
Ryan: That's... That's not the point!
Dwight: Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
Ryan: Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
Oscar: It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Ryan: Okay well, that's a relief!
Jim: Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Pam: Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
Jim: Tickets are 250 bucks.
Pam: 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Ryan: Yeah... Who's opening?
Jim: Paul Anka.
Ryan: Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Jim: Okay, you could just show up late though.
Ryan: How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Pam: Tears of a clown!
Ryan: Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Darryl: Looking good, RC!
Robert: Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
Angela: Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
Angela: My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Dwight: I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Jim: Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Oscar: What's going on?
Dwight: There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Erin: Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
Dwight: That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
Pam: Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
Phyllis: How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Dwight: I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
Nellie: I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
Andy: Hey!
Erin: Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Angela: We think you might kill Robert.
Andy: What?
Kevin: because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Andy: guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Pam: Oh, great! That sounds good!
Kevin: Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Andy: Why would that be weird?
Kevin: It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Erin: Andy's just coming as my date.
Kevin: Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Nellie: [hears knocks on door.] Come in!
Darryl: You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
Nellie: Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Darryl: I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Nellie: How are things in the warehouse?
Darryl: You could go downstairs and ask them?
Nellie: The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
Darryl: Who knew, right?
Nellie: [speechless.] I...
Nellie: Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Angela: Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
Andy: Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Kevin: Oh man, this is weird!
Robert: Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.]
Andy: Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
Andy: [points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
Kevin: Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
Creed: Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
Kevin: No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Dwight: [Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Kevin: Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
Dwight: You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Kevin: So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Andy: What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
Jim: Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Andy: The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Pam: Sounds like you're doing alright.
Andy: Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
Ryan: Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
Senator: You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
Oscar: my dog Gerald is my life.
Senator: really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me. [Walks away.]
Oscar: This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
Robert: [telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--
Andy: Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
Robert: Well...
Andy: You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Robert: So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
Andy: Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Robert: and the hero, who's that based on?
Andy: Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Meredith: Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Stanley: She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
Andy: You're being a Thomas Oregon!
Robert: Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
Andy: Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Robert: Andy you should leave. Now.
Andy: [to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Waiter: I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.
Andy: then I'll take a table!
Waiter: Okay
Andy: And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
Andy: [waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
Oscar: I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
Pam: Oh my god!
Oscar: I know!
Jim: Wait, what? Come on!
Oscar: We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Jim: Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Oscar: Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Jim: Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Pam: Whoa!
Jim: What happened, did he do it?
Pam: Are you-- Twice! For real?
Jim: Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Pam: Life is Downton Abbey.
Jim: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Dwight: [on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Dwight: It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
Andy: Hey... David Wallace!
David: Andy Bernard!
Andy: Hey, how are you?
David: How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
Andy: No, got canned last week.
David: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Andy: No, best thing that ever happened to me.
David: That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Andy: Yikes!
David: Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
Nellie: Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
Darryl: Tacos.
Nellie: What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Darryl: I can go get us some tacos.
Nellie: Brilliant!
Darryl: If you loan me some money.
Nellie: Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
Darryl: $30.00
Nellie: $30, yes!
Nellie: I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
Oscar: [Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Jim: Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
Oscar: This is interesting.
Pam: Hm-hmm.
Jim: what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Pam: Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Oscar: He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Pam: Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Jim: Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
Speaker: Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California!
Robert: Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
Andy: can you believe this guy?
Robert: The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]
Andy: Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
Robert: Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
Andy: I will! I will take all of those dogs!
Robert: Andy, that's very kind--
Andy: No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
Robert: Andy why don't we discuss this at a--
Andy: No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
Erin: Oh God!
Senator: Mr. Bernard, right this way.
Andy: Okay! Hope you all learned something!
Vet: Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream.
Andy: I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
Vet: Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.
Andy: Stupid dog.
Senator: Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number.
Meredith: Thank you!
Pam: Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
Oscar: sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Oscar: No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Darryl: Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
Nellie: Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!
Darryl: Hmhmm.
Nellie: Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
Darryl: She's trying.
Speaker: The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Yes! Thank you!
Speaker: The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
Speaker: A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Speaker: Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!
Dwight: Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Speaker: Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause]
Jim: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Dwight: Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
Senator: Oscar!
Oscar: Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Senator: It was lovely! And don't forget to call.
Oscar: okay
Senator: thanks so much for coming
Oscar: why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
Andy: [applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
Vet: that's right!
Andy: Ugh, oh god!
Vet: Yeah, you never get used to that.
Jim: Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Andy: I am so great!
Erin: He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Jim: Look at that one though, he's smiling!
Vet: Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle.
Andy: This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
Pam: Absolutely, it's awesome--
Jim: Yes--
Kevin: I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
Andy: You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
Vet: Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations.
Jim: Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Pam: Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
Andy: Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
Jim: Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Andy: Yeah, I do. I have that.
Jim: Yeah
Erin: You're going to be alright
Kevin: No. No he's not.
Andy: Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
Kevin: You're welcome!
Kevin: Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
Erin: So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Darryl: Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Kevin: My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Pam: What do you feed her?
Kevin: Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Darryl: Is she sick? How are her poops?
Kevin: Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Pam: Does she smell?
Kevin: She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
Kevin: People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
Jim: I���m taking some time off from work���well, my other work���because we needed it.
Pam: It���s great.
Jim: It���s great.
Pam: The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Jim: But that doesn���t matter. This does. It���s the only thing that matters. We���ve had some really nice days together.
Pam: Nice morning, too.
Jim: Beesly! Oh, my god.
Andy: Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent���s putting me up for a furniture commercial.
Jim: Ah, definitely blue.
Andy: Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what���s up? Back in the small pond?
Jim: For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin���
Andy: Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
Jim: Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can���t give 100% to two things at once you know.
Andy: Tell me about it, you know? I���ve been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don���t know if I���m wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
Jim: Huh. Well, you know, you can���t have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what���s most important. That���s my new thing.
Oscar: [noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
Angela: No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Kevin: Wait, all of them?
Angela: Two sacks��� worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
Oscar: That���s���that���s awful, Angela. I���m so sorry.
Angela: It���s the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She���s this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
Kevin: I���ve never met anyone like that.
Angela: And they���re gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
Oscar: Angela, you still have your son.
Angela: I guess.
Dwight: Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and���
Jim: Smasher!
Dwight: Smasher? No, where���d you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city���s best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
Dwight: I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don���t spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
Dwight: I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Jim: Fireball!
Dwight: Ah! [throws punch] That���s how it���s done.
Jim: That���s pretty good. I feel safe.
David Wallace: Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?
Erin: Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said ���is Indian��� and was like, ���Is Indian what?��� Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Erin: Lately, I���ve been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy���s calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
Erin: Yes, there���s Andy! Andy is in. I���m a good receptionist, I know he���s in.
Andy: David Walrus, in his native habitat.
David Wallace: Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
Andy: Yeah.
David Wallace: This isn���t going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, ���The kind that���s good for head shots.��� And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it���s gonna boost office morale. Now, he���s a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
David Wallace: Andy���
Andy: I���m gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it���s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
David Wallace: Uh-huh, but���
Andy: Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I���ll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
David Wallace: So you think you���ve been too focused on your job?
Andy: At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
David Wallace: So you���you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
Andy: Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don���t���it just��� I owe it to myself and my future fans.
David Wallace: Uh, well, I guess I can���t stand in the way of a man���s dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
Andy: Thank you, David.
David Wallace: There���s probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Andy: Nope. I have made up my mind. I���m really sorry.
David Wallace: Well, good luck.
Andy: Thank you. Not gonna need it.
David Wallace: Okay.
David Wallace: Well that kind of worked out.
Creed: I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Jim: Oh, Clark. I���m actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
Clark: Right. Yeah. But, you know, I���ve actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I���ve earned this. I mean, you know?
Jim: You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I���m here.
Clark: Right. Well, I���m here to sell paper.
Pam: Wow.
Clark: All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And���and Wallace is here today. And I don���t him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
Pam: it���s okay. You can sit in the annex.
Jim: What?
Pam: I���ll come visit you.
Jim: Okay. The annex it is. I���ll be sitting at your desk if that���s okay with you.
Clark: That���s fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete���s beautiful, dead eyes.
Andy: Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I���m taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
Oscar: I can���t say we didn���t see it coming. But it���s a sad day when anybody is fired. We���re so sorry, Andy.
David Wallace: Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
Andy: I wasn���t fired. What are you talking about? I���m fired up, yes. Guys, I���m���I���m leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
Pam: Oh, Andy.
Andy: Yeah, so, I���ll see you on the red carpet. See, that���s how it works.
Phyllis: Andy sings beautifully. And he���s really good at dancing. He���s a good speaker. But there���s just something there you don���t want to look at.
Jim: Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Pete: Yeah, a little bit.
Jim: Oh, wow. But, um���Oh, I get that.
Pete: Oh, no, no, no. No it���s cool.
Jim: I get it.
Pete: It���s cool, man. I���m sure you and I will have our own thing.
Jim: Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don���t watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
Darryl: I just think you���re going into this a little fast.
Andy: I���m 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
Darryl: Show business is cold. Let���s say you get a job, which you probably won���t. They���re not gonna cut you any slack. You���re meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
Andy: All right. I get it.
Andy: The male is a funny species. We don���t just tell each other how we feel, that���s chick stuff. So instead of saying, ���Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don���t want you to leave.��� You say something like, ���Hey, Andy, you���re making the worst mistake of your life. You���re not talented.��� Well��� right back at you, Darryl.
Andy: [hugs Darryl] I���m gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Stanley: Andy���s from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Kevin: Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don���t know. You know who���s really funny? This bird, in the park, that can���t fly right. I���d pay to see him. But I don���t have to cause the park is free!
Sensei: I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.
Dwight: He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Sensei: It���s not a large room, I think they heard me.
Dwight: Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
Sensei: That���s really ok. I���m mostly focused on the belt here.
Dwight: Just slip it off my���Slip it off my hips.
Sensei: Hold it���Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can���t���I can���t do this if you���re gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we���re gonna have to cut this off.
Dwight: He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Angela: Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Dwight: There it is. [everyone applauds]
Sensei: Congratulations.
Dwight: We did it, we did it. I love you.
Sensei: Okay.
Dwight: Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You���re gonna watch me right?
Sensei: Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate]
Dwight: Sensei, you���re not watching.
Sensei: Yeah, I���m watching. Just do it.
Dwight: Watching?
Sensei: I���m watching.
Dwight: Watch this part, okay?
David Wallace: Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
Sensei: Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.
David Wallace: He said that? He���s an odd guy, isn���t he?
Sensei: Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he���s one of the most tenacious and determined men I���ve ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]
Esther: Oh! I���m am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
Jim: I really felt like I almost lost her, and���and nothing is worth that.
David Wallace: Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn���t even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
Clark: Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
Dwight: You did not just say that! You don���t know Pam. She is really cool.
Clark: All I���m saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager���s chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
Dwight: Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It���s out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I���d be happy to see Jim as manager.
David Wallace: So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
Jim: Again.
David Wallace: Again! And I���m looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
Jim: Not at all. It should be Dwight.
David Wallace: You sure?
Jim: You���re gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh���
David Wallace: Yeah.
Jim: Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don���t want to meet that person.
Nellie: Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Andy: It���s now or never.
Nellie: Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
Andy: Yeah, sure. What���s your question?
Kevin: Our question is���it seems dumb.
Andy: Well, it���s better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
Nellie: Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and ���full-ass��� it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
Andy: Nah. I like my plan better.
Kevin: Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You���re too character-y to be a lead and you���re not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Andy: What?
Oscar: No, I don���t think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can���t make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Jim: Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
Pam: Yes. Yeah.
Jim: I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
Pam: Oh, boy. Um���
Jim: If you could help me out, that would be���
Pam: I could give you some beginner stickies?
Jim: Anything would help.
Pam: Here you go.
Jim: Oh, also, while you���re at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Jim: Wow, that���s���
Pam: It���s all yours.
Jim: You come so prepared. Aspirin.
Dwight: You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Jim: Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It���s really great.
Dwight: Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager���s job?
Jim: No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
Dwight: Yeah, right. I���m afraid that ship has sailed.
Jim: I wouldn���t be too sure about that. Just saying.
Dwight: Hello.
Andy: Well, hello.
Dwight: Big day for you.
Andy: Big day for you.
Dwight: Thank you.
Andy: Love the belt.
Dwight: Oh, yes.
Andy: You know, I don���t know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog���s outta here, so letting it all hang out!
Dwight: This is exciting! You���re finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Andy: Thank you, I appreciate that. ���Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Dwight: Oh, I doubt you���ll make it. Very few do who���ve tried to be a star. But, listen, you���ve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Andy: No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
Dwight: Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don���t quit your day job.
Andy: [cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
Dwight: You���re bad.
Andy: I���m gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
Andy: Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That���s something you can���t take back.
Erin: So true. Is there a question, or are���what?
Andy: Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
Erin: Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Andy: Thank you. [steps into conference room]
David Wallace: You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
Andy: Thank you. [leaves]
David Wallace: Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
Dwight: Say it again.
David Wallace: Will you be the new manager?
Dwight: Where?
David Wallace: Where?
Dwight: What branch?
David Wallace: Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let���s go. It���s good news.
Dwight: I���m sorry. I���ve just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
David Wallace: What?
Dwight: But this isn���t interim manager. No. It���s Dwight K. Schrute��� [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
David Wallace: Why do you already have this?
Dwight: In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
David Wallace: I know.
Dwight: I will never, ever let you down.
David Wallace: I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight���s hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You���re gonna do great.
Pam: Hey.
Jim: Wow, hey.
Pam: Hi.
Jim: What���s up?
Pam: Um, I have a question.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Oh, I had a question.
Jim: Really?
Pam: I did!
Jim: Yeah, totally you did.
Pam: Super important.
Jim: I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: All right? I���m gonna wait.
Pam: All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
Jim: I���m sure you did not. What was your question?
Pam: I don���t know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Jim: Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I���m waiting.
Pam: Exactly.
Andy: Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I���m gonna stay on in sales.
Nellie: Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
Meredith: Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don���t want to see you in a porn next year.
Andy: Okay.
Kevin: Ooh, there���s a great play about a salesman.
Andy: Death of a salesman.
Kevin: I don���t think so.
Andy: Sure, ���Death of a Salesman��� by Arthur Miller, it���s a great play about crushed dreams.
Kevin: No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
Andy: [sits at Dwight���s desk] Got any hot leads?
Pete: See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
Erin: I had no idea. And here I���ve been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin��� sheep.
Jim: Look who���s back.
Pam: I���m back. Oh, hey, look, and now it���s like a double date.
Pete: Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
Erin: Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That���d be fun.
Pam: Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Erin: Well, how about Thursday?
Pam: Oh, well, Thursday���s tough, because of���
Jim: Weeknights are actually tough just because���
Pam: They are.
Jim: That���s true, yeah.
Erin: Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
David Wallace: Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute���
Dwight: David. Can I just do one thing while you���re making this announcement and then I���ll never, ever do it again?
David Wallace: I don���t think so.
Dwight: It���s just one thing. Just let me���let me do this���
David Wallace: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on���what I was about to say was Dwight���[phone buzzes] Oh, I���m sorry, I gotta���This���ll be a second, sorry.
Dwight: Just wait and send it to voicemail.
David Wallace: Yeah.
Dwight: Come on. Come on.
David Wallace: [on phone] Then we���ll get him a new set of drums.
Dwight: [climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
Andy: Brava, brava.
Creed: [from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
Pam: What���s going on?
Kevin: Dwight���s the new manager. He freaking did it.
Pam: [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.
Dwight: Pam.
Jim: [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
Dwight: Thank you, Jim.
Clark: Congrats, Dwight.
Dwight: Get out of Jim���s seat.
Clark: But I fought for this seat.
Dwight: You���re an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we���ll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
Pam: It���s nice to have you back.
Dwight: So���
Jim: So.
Dwight: I wanted to offer you a new position.
Jim: Let���s hear it.
Dwight: Assistant regional manager.
Jim: Nope. Can���t accept that job. It���s not a real job.
Dwight: Jim.
Jim: I���ll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I���d be proud to take.
Dwight: Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Jim: Don���t get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Dwight: So, all the numbers adding up?
Oscar: Hey, I didn���t get a chance to say it, but��� congratulations, Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you.
Angela: Yes. Congratulations.
Kevin: Yeah, and Dwight, I���d like to be the first to say congratulations.
Angela: This is a big day for you.
Dwight: Yes, it is. Carry on.
Andy: How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It���s cause I had a fallback. That���s the problem. When you have fallbacks, it���s just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
Andy: Everyone! Changed my mind again.
Phyllis: What���s it now, dream or no dream?
Andy: Uh, dream. Goin��� with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn���t that right, Jim?
Jim: Oh, don���t look at me cause I think you���re making a terrible choice.
Andy: All in! Whoo!
Andy: Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
Toby: Okay, then, Andy.
Andy: Yeah, but here���s the thing. I can���t have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I���ll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
Toby: Andy, you know I can���t do that. It���d be lying.
Andy: Seriously?
Toby: Yeah, I���m���
Andy: Come on, just do it.
Toby: I can���t.
Andy: All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby���s thighs]
Toby: [fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
Andy: God, Toby, don���t���stop blocking my hand.
Toby: No, no.
Andy: This is your���you brought this on.
Toby: No, no. Andy.
Andy: Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
Angela: [answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there���s a problem it���s clearly on your end. And���oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um��� what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn���t want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should���ve taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
Kevin: What do you think that was about?
Andy: David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I���d just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
David Wallace: We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
Andy: What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
David Wallace: Enough, Andy. Enough!
Andy: Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
David Wallace: Oh my god.
Andy: Eleanor Roosevelt once said ���the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.��� [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she���s right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I���m doing the right thing.
Angela: Andy.
Andy: Yeah.
Angela: What are you doing?
Andy: Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don���t squash my knickety-knacks on top.
Angela: Yeah, okay. That���s not what I mean. You don���t have to leave because you said you would. Don���t let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It���s not worth it.
Andy: Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too���
Angela: Ugh.
Andy: But I just���it���s in the past. And I feel like we shouldn���t���
Angela: No, that���s not���
Andy: Rehash���
Angela: No, none���No, stop. It���s just���
Andy: Exactly.
Angela: Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Andy: Thanks, Angela. You too.
Angela: Thanks.
Andy: A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
Nellie: Oh, good lord.
Stanley: Can���t you just leave?
Jim: You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Andy: Tuna, I���m a performer. And perform I shall. [sings ���I Will Remember You������everyone is slightly impressed]
Dwight: [whispering] You okay?
Angela: [crying] It���s just a really nice song.
Kevin: [everyone applauding] Awesome!
Phyllis: Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He���s not terrible.
Stanley: Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Phyllis: No, he���s good.
Stanley: He was good.
Oscar: Good night, Kevin.
Kevin: Night, Oscar.
Oscar: Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Angela: Well, I���ve changed my mind.
Oscar: Wait a minute. You���re not thinking of living in a���
Angela: Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Oscar: Okay, I���m just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
Angela: Oh, god.
Oscar: Come stay with me.
Angela: You don���t want me at your place.
Oscar: I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won���t be long. It���s the least I could do.
Angela: Well���
Oscar: Separate bathrooms.
Angela: Thank you.
Oscar: You���re welcome. Let���s go get Phillip. Then we���ll get your stuff���
Angela: Okay.
Oscar: And get you the hell outta that place.
Angela: Are you allowed to have pets?
Oscar: Oh, Angela.
Dwight: Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Darryl: You talk to Wade and Colin?
Jim: No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What���s up?
Darryl: We got an offer on the table.
Jim: What kind of offer?
Darryl: A buyout.
Jim: What?
Darryl: We���re in play, baby.
Jim: Oh, my god!
Darryl: We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it���s not just a Philly play, so get this: they���re gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Jim: Wow, that is��� wow.
Darryl: Yeah, we did it.
Jim: Yeah, we did. Hey, how long���how long do we think that���s gonna take?
Darryl: Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Jim: Oh, man. Yeah, I can���t do it.
Darryl: Can���t do what?
Jim: This, man. I can���t do this to Pam.
Darryl: No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
Jim: I know. And I can���t do it.
Angela: So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
Oscar: No, it���s neat and tasteful, like most gay men���s homes. The stereotype holds up.
Angela: I wouldn���t know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Oscar: Angela, you just were���
Angela: [starts sobbing] I love him.
Oscar: I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You���you can���t���
Angela: No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Kevin: But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Dwight: Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they���re protecting America���s real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day���s security codes. Something that���s been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It���s not the KGB, but it���s a start.
Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Dwight: But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Erin: Close.
Dwight: This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
Erin: Colder.
Dwight: The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
Erin: No, I meant you���re getting colder. The correct response is, ���the coffee in Peru is much hotter.���
Dwight: Ah, much, ok.
Erin: But, that���s three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Dwight: No, no. Give me the steam.
Dwight: It���s just harmless steam to panic intruders. I���d like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Dwight: [while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
Creed: [carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I���m saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
Philip: Mama!
Oscar: Angela, someone wants you.
Angela: Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
Oscar: Angela���s divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it���s Angela who���s living in the closet. Hey-o.
Oscar: Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Esther: Go get ���em, honey.
Dwight: Oh, don���t worry. They���ll get got.
Dwight: Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check��� on that later today. This is my grandmother���s ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother���s buttock bullet ring.
Andy: Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that���s premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
Check-in guy: Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.
Andy: Yes!
Andy: Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America���s Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It���s a really cool show, it���s like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
Jim: Sales form for you to sign.
Dwight: You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Dwight: Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Jim: Aw, thanks, man.
Dwight: Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we���ve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War���
Jim: No.
Dwight: Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Jim: Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
Pam: Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
Jim: All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
Pam: Is that them again?
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Maybe you should call back?
Jim: I will. I will.
Jim: The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that���s final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I���m not risking that again.
Pam: When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he���s giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he���s certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
Dwight: Welcome.
Jim: He welcomes you.
Dwight: Please take an agenda item.
Jim: Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Dwight: Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. ���Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.��� [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Jim: Let���s not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you���re expecting a fax today, please don���t yell out, ���Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.��� Ok? That���s nonsense.
Pam: Question.
Jim: Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Pam: We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they���re delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, ���Nice jugs���?
Jim: That���s obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Everyone: [overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can���t have nonsense.
Dwight: [as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
Angela: Daycare won���t take Phillip anymore.
Oscar: Why?
Angela: Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won���t forgive. So, hi.
Oscar: Hi, buddy.
Dwight: Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Jim: Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who���s excited?
Meredith: I���d better come out of this smelling like a rose. I���ve been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn���t for the cameras, I would���ve done some truly vulgar crap.
Stanley: Over the course of this documentary I���ve had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
Dwight: I���m letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
Kevin: Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard���s. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Oscar: I can���t believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
Creed: This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
Andy: This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang ���I Dreamed a Dream��� from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Casey: Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.
Andy: No!
Casey: America wants it!
Andy: No, this is my time! You don���t belt on my time! I belt on my time.
Casey: [singing] Casey Dean!
Andy: [vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!
Casey: Man, those are some nice pipes.
Andy: Yeah.
Casey: What���s your name?
Andy: Andy. What���s yours?
Angela: Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Oscar: Why didn���t you pack the apple snacks?
Kevin: Guys.
Angela: Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
Kevin: Guys.
Angela: Why don���t you pack it?
Kevin: Guys.
Angela & Oscar: Kevin, what?
Kevin: Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says ���bold front��� instead of ���cold front���? It���s insane.
Angela: Not now, Kevin. Can���t you see we���re busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Oscar: Seriously, Kevin. I���m just gonna have to go to the store.
Angela: Ok, you go to the store.
Kevin: Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It���s all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Dwight: Not now! Private time!
Jim: I love Star Wars as much as the next guy���
Dwight: Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
Jim: My god, I���m so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Dwight: Which is, of course���
Jim: Potential future nonsense.
Dwight: Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Jim: I���m gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You���ve got a regional manager.
Dwight: The power source.
Jim: Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
Dwight: A loyal, but bungling apostle.
Jim: But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Dwight: Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Jim: Exactly.
Dwight: I���d have to get some more wire and string, but it���s doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Jim: Yeah, right. I mean, unless they���re willing to pass some tests.
Dwight: I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Jim: Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
Dwight: That doesn���t sound crazy, Jim. That���s the sanest thing I���ve ever heard.
Casey: What���re you listening to?
Andy: Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
Casey: Oh, sweet.
Andy: A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
Mark McGrath: What���s up, everybody? And welcome to America���s Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!
Casey: Ah! It���s Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You���re gorgeous!
Mark McGrath: Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!
Andy: There���s a mole?
Mark McGrath: Oops. I���m not supposed to���I���m not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?
Andy: What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Mark McGrath: Good man right there. I���ll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?
Andy: Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
Casey: What? On a roll much?
Andy: I don���t know where it came from.
Casey: That was amazing, man!
Andy: Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Casey: Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.
Andy: I did, I felt it.
Casey: Big time.
Pam: What are you so excited about?
Jim: Nothing.
Pam: What are you up to?
Jim: Members of the office, hear ye.
Dwight: That means ye, Plop!
Pete: Plop? Still?
Dwight: We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Pete: Fine.
Jim: Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Erin: Aw, heck ya!
Pam: Nice.
Dwight: You���ll always have the upper hand, when you���ve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Jim: This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that���s for fueling only. No savoring.
Dwight: Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
Jim: He envies you.
Dwight: You don���t need to repeat right now, when I���m saying it.
Jim: Alright.
Jim: By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Darryl: What up?
Glenn: What���s going on? How was the delivery?
Darryl: Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I���m here.
Darryl: I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Jim: A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Meredith: Uh, two.
Jim: 985,000,000,000,017.00
Dwight: Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
Jim: Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Pam: Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
Jim: Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Dwight: Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other���s minds. You���re trying to give your wife this job.
Jim: That���s exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Pete: A horse.
Jim: Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
Pete: What���s the opposite of a horse?
Jim: Come on.
Jim & Dwight: Sea horse.
Jim: Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna���
Jim & Dwight: Say that? Uncanny.
Jim: Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
Clark: Yeah.
Jim: Do you want a corn dog?
Clark: I would love a corn dog.
Jim: We���ll see. You are an assistant who���s just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Clark: [reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.���
Dwight: No, no, no, no! You don���t read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There���s no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don���t have diplomatic relations.
Jim: Uncanny.
Soldier: I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they���ll feel like anything is possible.
Andy: Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
Casey: Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.
Andy: What?
Casey: Yeah.
Andy: Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
Casey: I don���t know. But I���m getting really worried here.
Andy: Me too. Hold my place in line.
Casey: Where are you going?
Andy: They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Darryl: Thanks, man.
Hank: Thank you.
Darryl: Yep. Take care.
Pam: Darryl, hey.
Darryl: Hey.
Pam: Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
Darryl: No, no, I���m not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn���t say goodbye to.
Pam: Aha. How���s Athlead?
Darryl: We livin��� like rock stars. I���m about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Pam: Wow.
Darryl: Jim really doesn���t want to come?
Pam: He says he doesn���t want to.
Darryl: Wow. Man. I hope he doesn���t regret it.
Pam: Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
Darryl: Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
Pam: That���s what he says.
Darryl: If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Jim: An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Dwight: A thousand times more.
Phyllis: I���ll try this one.
Jim: Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Phyllis: [grabbing the coffee] Hot!
Jim: Yeah. It���s real. It���s the only way you���ll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She���s through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Dwight: [over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
Jim: Look at that form.
Dwight: [running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here���s your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
Jim: Uncanny. [everyone applauds]
Erin: Darryl?! Darryl!
Kevin: Whoa.
Darryl: Oh, hey. Hey, what���s up, y���all?
Erin: You left us without saying goodbye.
Darryl: Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
Meredith: Hey! No way!
Kevin: That���s totally uncool.
Erin: Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Darryl: I don���t think I sh-
Erin: Get upstairs, mister!
Meredith: Yeah!
Kevin: Right. Now.
Darryl: Guess I���m going upstairs.
Jim: You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing���none of these people are good enough.
Dwight: I know.
Jim: What I���m about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I���ve ever said.
Dwight: Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Jim: Is-
Dwight: Me.
Jim: The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight: Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.
Jim: I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That���s it. You look really, really good.
Dwight: Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Jim: Hey.
Pam: Hey.
Jim: You all right? What���s going on?
Pam: Are you happy?
Jim: Yes, I���m happy.
Pam: No, I know that you���re, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Jim: What?
Pam: What about five years from now?
Jim: Pam.
Pam: Because I���m so glad you���re back, baby, but I���m just���I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you���re giving up so much.
Jim: This was my decision, not yours.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: You didn���t force me.
Pam: I kind of forced you to do it.
Jim: You did not force me to do this.
Pam: Yes, I did.
Jim: I don���t know how else to tell you.
Pam: I���m afraid that you���re gonna resent me and I���m afraid that���
Jim: Resent you?
Pam: This is not enough for you and I���m afraid that I���m not enough for you.
Jim: Is that really what you think?
Jim: Not enough? I don���t know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it���s against the rules but I���m gonna need a favor from you guys.
Camera Crew: Okay. You got it, man.
Darryl: I didn���t realize we were this close.
Phyllis: We���re all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Meredith: Are you gonna come to Poor Richard���s and watch with us tonight?
Darryl: Uh��� yeah. Depending on traffic.
Stanley: He ain���t coming.
Erin: Oh, god!
Darryl: These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Darryl: Well, it���s been great.
Phyllis: Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he���s gone for who knows how long.
Darryl: Maybe forever. Anyhow���
Oscar: Did we ever have lunch together, just���just the two of us? You know what, I���m gonna make reservations right now at Cugino���s.
Meredith: Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Darryl: Oh, oh, I���m sure we did.
Meredith: Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Clark: Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Erin: Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl���s next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we���ll get this started.
Darryl: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that���s on me. But I���m not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you���re feeling sentimental.
Meredith: You have to! [everyone grumbling]
Darryl: Hey, hey, hey. I���ll do one thing with y���all.
Phyllis: Which thing?
Darryl: I don���t care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Angela: Kevin, Kevin.
Kevin: Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
Angela: Kevin, could you not do that?
Kevin: What? I���m moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Oscar: Here, use my pen.
Kevin: Don���t tell me what to do!
Angela & Oscar: Shhh!
Kevin: No, I don���t need this! And you obviously don���t need me.
Angela: Kevin, where are you going?
Kevin: Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Oscar: He just won���t go down. It���s as if he���s excited by all this paper.
Angela: I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Dwight: Smart baby. That���s the most flavorful bond.
Andy: Hey, what���s goin��� on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young���uns?
Casey: You���re back!
Andy: No, it���s me, Andy!
Casey: No, I know.
Andy: No, no, no. I���m wearing makeup.
Casey: You did a really great job. You even look shorter.
Andy: Oh, I took out my lifts.
Casey: Oh.
Andy: Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
Casey: Oh.
Esther: All day long, it���s moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
Dwight: Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
Esther: Dwight, I���m telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
Dwight: The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Dwight: [puts his grandmother���s ring away] Thank you, Esther.
Esther: Bye.
Jim: You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Dwight: I need you to perform a test.
Jim: Perform a test.
Dwight: On an innocent baby.
Jim: Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I���m gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don���t worry, he���s the best in the biz.
Dwight: Damn straight.
Jim: Unless you think he can���t handle it.
Dwight: Hey, he can handle it.
Jim: All right.
Oscar: [holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley���s sleeping. You don���t want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Stanley: I heard that.
Phillip: Mama.
Dwight: Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there���s no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Pam: He does have a gift.
Oscar: Well, he���s calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Phillip: Mama.
Dwight: Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager���s office before?
Dwight: Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It���s called ���Schrute or Consequences.��� You���re gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
Phillip: Beet.
Dwight: Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you���re no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Check-in guy: Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions.
People in line: Oh come on! Hey!
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Check-in guy: But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America���s Next A Cappella Sensa���
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can���t do that. You can���t do that, we���ve all been waiting.
Check-in guy: Okay.
Andy: I am going in there! Don���t���
Check-in guy: No, you���re not, sir.
Andy: Don���t���don���t���
Check-in guy: Please don���t.
Andy: Don���t touch me.
Check-in guy: I���m not touching you. Okay? [Andy makes a break for it]
Casey: Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don���t you dare. Don���t get���I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I���m Casey Dean! You���ll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won���t be seeing the last of me!
Oscar: Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don���t know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
Dwight: That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he���s being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Kevin: He���s not that smart. He doesn���t know where I hid his duck.
Andy: [interrupting contestant singing ���Beautiful��� by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You���re still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You���re like, my three favorite people ever.
Santigold: What is this?
Andy: [shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you���re amazing, okay? You���re obviously gonna be on the show, so it���s someone else���s turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I���m just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
Aaron Rodgers: No, you���re a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.
Andy: Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
Clay Aiken: No, we do not want to hear you sing.
Santigold: Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.
Andy: Nope! Can���t end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss���s car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
Aaron Rodgers: Flag on the play.
Andy: That���s���that���s what���yeah. Okay, all right, well, here���s the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga���s waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater���
Santigold: What is this song?
Andy: Are you insane? It���s the Cornell fight song.
Clay Aiken: Listen, all right, thank you very much, we���re not interested.
Andy: You didn���t let me finish. That���s not fair.
Aaron Rodgers: Look, man, you���re not terrible. We���ve heard a lot of really good singers today and you���re just not good enough.
Andy: Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that���s the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
Aaron Rodgers: Can he do this?
Andy: [singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you���re never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges��� reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly���
Santigold: Look, you gotta go. [Andy falls to his knees, sobbing] You can���t just sit here and cry.
Andy: Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
Jim: [addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Oscar: Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
Kevin: Can���t hear you. I���m giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Oscar: Okay, I guess, it���s just that Phillip got you something.
Angela: Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
Oscar: I think there���s, like, $7 left.
Angela: It���s just his way of saying, ���Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.���
Kevin: Phillip got this for me?
Oscar: Sure.
Kevin: That was a really cool move.
Angela: Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That���s Kevin.
Kevin: Whoa.
Oscar: Easy.
Kevin: What a chubbers. Whoa.
Angela: Okay, watch it.
Kevin: I���m losing my balance.
Angela: No, Kevin, no.
Oscar: Hey, no.
Kevin: Whoa!
Oscar: No horseplay.
Angela: Stop it.
Kevin: You wanna play with the cactus?
Angela: No, no!
Kevin: So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we���re gonna be best friends. He���s a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Erin: We have our decision.
Darryl: You chose one thing?
Erin: We want to dance with you.
Darryl: You want to dance?
Erin: One dance, all of us together.
Darryl: This is what you want?
Erin: Absolutely.
Darryl: Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we���re gonna do this right.
Erin: Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
Angela: Hey. You wanted to see me?
Dwight: Door. Chair. It���s about Phillip.
Angela: I am sorry he���s here today but I had���
Dwight: I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Angela: How thoughtful.
Dwight: Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let���s face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man���s closet.
Angela: If he is your son, that���s a great plan. But he���s not. He���s not your son.
Dwight: Very well.
Angela: Can I go back to my desk now?
Dwight: Yes.
Pam: What is this?
Jim: Well I���ve been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn���t believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
Dwight: Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
Jim: OK, I don���t have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
Dwight: [throws ���now��� beanbag at Jim] Now.
Jim: I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Dwight: Jim. I���m not kidding. I need you.
Pam: Go ahead.
Jim: Ok, um, this is��� [leaves DVD with her]���I���ll be right back.
Jim: What do we got?
Dwight: I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Jim: Wow! Congratulations, that���s a really big step.
Dwight: She���s got a ton of great qualities. She���s young, she���s beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we���re third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn���t technically incest.
Jim: Right in the sweet spot. I think you���re gonna be really happy.
Dwight: Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Jim: [whistles] That���s a lot of pros.
Dwight: And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Jim: So what is the problem?
Dwight: Angela.
Jim: I don���t know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I���ve been faced with a tough decision, there���s only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
Dwight: Some sort of virus?
Jim: Love.
Dwight: Oh.
Jim: Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who���s gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
Dwight: You���re a good assistant, Jim.
Jim: Not as good as you.
Dwight: That���s very true. Get the hell outta here.
Jim: You got it.
Jim: You watched it.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Well, then I guess you���re ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
Pam: What���s that?
Jim: It���s from the teapot. Everything you���ll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Pam: Thank you.
Erin: Ok, everybody ready?
Phyllis: Hit it, red! [���Boogie Wonderland��� by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Darryl: I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I���m gonna miss these guys.
Oscar: Ok, I���ve got my���
Meredith: See you guys at Poor Richard���s, all right?
Oscar: All right, Meredith.
Angela: Okay, bye.
Oscar: See you there.
Kevin: Bye, Phillip. High five.
Oscar: Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother���s, and I���ll meet you at Poor Richard���s in an hour.
Angela: Are you sure you don���t want me to drop him off?
Oscar: She doesn���t know I���m living with a straight woman. I don���t want to get her hopes up.
Angela: All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
Oscar: Oh, my goodness.
Dwight: [in bullhorn] Pull over!
Angela: Dwight?
Dwight: Move to the side of the road!
Angela: Why?
Dwight: Pull over!
Angela: What do you���Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
Angela: [getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Dwight: [on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!
Angela: Who drives like that?
Dwight: Listen to me! I love you! And I don���t care that Phillip���s not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Angela: Can you put that down?
Dwight: This expresses how loudly I love you.
Angela: It���s too loud.
Dwight: [puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
Angela: Okay, yes���yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
Dwight: I love you!
Angela: And I lied to you.
Dwight: What?
Angela: Phillip���s your son.
Dwight: What? Why would you say that���
Angela: I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Dwight: [excited] Get out! I���m a dad!
Angela: You���re a dad!
Creed: Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor���s up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed���s head] Oh!
Erin: You have to change the channel to PBS.
Kevin: Yeah.
Bartender: College baseball is on.
Erin: But there���s a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Bartender: What���s it about?
Erin: A paper company.
Bartender: How many people want the game? [half the bar cheers] Who wants PBS? [other half cheers] Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.
Kevin: Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
Andy: One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
Bartender: All right.
Kevin: Yes!
Clark: Hey, how was the singing show audition?
Andy: Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
Creed: Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!
Kevin: I feel scared a little.
Phyllis: Yeah, I���m not ready for this.
Stanley: No one is ready for this. You can���t be ready for this. We don���t even know what this is.
Oscar: One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
Jim: Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of ���Pilot���]
