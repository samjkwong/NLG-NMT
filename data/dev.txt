Dwight: Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.
Jim: You look cute today, Dwight.
Dwight: Thanks, girl.
Jim: So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight
Dwight: Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.
Kevin: [nods] Hey...
Dwight: I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.
Jim: [mimicking Stanley] I enjoy the tangy zip of Miracle Whip.
Pam: [laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.
Kelly: And the guys are saying, chug, chug, chug, but I'm so small and all I'd eaten that day was one of those Auntie Anne pretzels from the food court so I said 'Is it okay if I sip it?' and they said no, but Ryan seemed cool either way.
Dwight: Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?
Kelly: Six.
Dwight: I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.
Ryan: I go to a lot of parties.
Dwight: Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.
Ryan: I am not giving you my keys.
Dwight: Don't make me do this the hard way.
Ryan: What's the hard way?
Dwight: I go down to the police station on my lunch break. I tell a police officer, I know several, what I suspect you may have in your car. He requests a hearing from a judge and obtains a search warrant, once he has said warrant, he will drive over here, and make you give him the keys to your car, and you will have to obey him.
Ryan: Yeah, let's do it that way.
Michael: Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
Dwight: I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.
Jim: Whoa. You are a volunteer.
Dwight: I volunteered for this job.
Jim: And that's not the same.
Dwight: It is my duty...
Jim: [interrupting] Volunteer duty.
Dwight: ...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.
Michael: [fake coughing] Narc!
Kevin: [giggling]
Dwight: If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.
Michael: I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
Dwight: Well, you have...
Michael: Uuf, well...
Dwight: ...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
Michael: [shakes head] Okay...
Dwight: ...and I am very proud of being a narc.
Michael: Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
Jim: Well, your office is behind you.
Michael: Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
Ryan: I don't think Michael's ever done drugs. I don't know if anyone has ever offered him any.
Dwight: Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.
Dwight: Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?
Oscar: No, I have not.
Dwight: Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?
Oscar: What are you implying?
Dwight: Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?
Oscar: Okay. I'm done with this.
Dwight: He sure left in a hurry.
Dwight: I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.
Dwight: Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her]
Phyllis: Yes, it's marijuana.
Dwight: How do you know that?
Phyllis: It's labeled.
Dwight: [grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.
Creed: That is Northern Lights Cannabis Indica.
Dwight: No, it's marijuana.
Jim: I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.
Dwight: That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.
Jim: Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.
Dwight: I would remember.
Jim: Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?
Dwight: That's not how it works.
Jim: Now how do you know how it works?
Dwight: Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.
Jim: No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?
Dwight: [opens eyes wide in total surprise]
Oscar: So Pam told me that you do a great Stanley impression, I'd love to hear it.
Jim: Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]
Stanley: Is that supposed to be me?
Jim: Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.
Stanley: I do not think that is funny.
Pam: He does everyone in the office.
Stanley: Hmmmpt.
Pam/Jim: [in unison] I do not think that is funny.
Pam: Jinx! Buy me a coke.
Jim: Oh...
Pam: No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]
Pam: Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.
Jim: [mouths] C'mon!
Pam: Sorry, that's not my problem.
Jim: [presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]
Dwight: I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.
Angela: I understand.
Dwight: Where were you yesterday after work?
Angela: [smiles knowingly]
Michael: Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?
Kevin: That is so good, Michael
Michael: Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
Dwight: Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.
Michael: Waa... what? What are you talking about?
Dwight: Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.
Oscar: Is that true, Toby?
Toby: Oh, when you sign your job application you agree to comply with random drug testing.
Michael: Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.
Michael: Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.
Dwight: No you can't do that.
Michael: I can do that, it is my office.
Dwight: No you cannot. It has to be official, and it
Michael: Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.
Dwight: Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?
Kevin: I'm not taking Rogaine.
Dwight: Angela, what about you?
Angela: I don't take any prescription drugs.
Dwight: You're not on
Angela: [Gives Dwight a knowing look]
Dwight: Good.
Kelly: So the first time we went out to dinner, it was like, whatever, fine, but I was so nervous. So this time I wanted to be special, so I bought a new dress! [Jim hunches his shoulders and grins] One of those kinds that is kinda low cut at top to show something, but not everything. [Jim shakes his head no in agreement] I mean not everything, Jim. [Jim shakes his head in agreement] I promise, I'm not that kind of...
Pam: Hey guys, what's going on?
Kelly: We're having the best conversation.  [Jim, eyes wide, shakes his head, no]
Pam: Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']
Kelly: So, I was looking so hot...
Michael: It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.
Phyllis: We don't feel that way.
Angela: No, not at all.
Oscar: You were the one joking around calling Dwight a narc.
Michael: No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'
Dwight: Thank you, Michael.
Michael: I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.
Michael: Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.
Stanley: Where did you get these facts?
Michael: Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
Stanley: They are not.
Michael: Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
Stanley: No, I don't. I have a glass of red wine with dinner about once a week.  For the antioxidants.
Michael: Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
Toby: Hookah is not an illegal drug, Michael.
Michael: Yes it is.
Toby: No it's not. It's a type of pipe. You can fill it with tobacco, often mixed with fruit, or other flavors.
Michael: Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
Toby: You can't do that.
Michael: I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
Toby: That's not random.
Michael: Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.
Pam: I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.
Michael: Really? [Jim shakes his head no]
Pam: Uh, hmmm.
Michael: Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.
Pam: Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.
Michael: The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.
Dwight: No, you will be tested.
Michael: Yes, I will not be.
Dwight: You will be. That is the law according to the rules.
Michael: Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
Dwight: Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.
Linda: We test a lot of urine.
Dwight: Mine was green.
Linda: Oh, right. How are you?
Dwight: I'm all better.
Michael: So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.
Dwight: What kind of filing?
Michael: Just forget it.  Just the urine.
Dwight: That goes directly to the tester.
Michael: Just. I need your urine.
Dwight: Like in a cup?
Michael: Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
Dwight: For what purpose?
Michael: It's none of your business.
Dwight: Then I refuse.
Michael: Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
Dwight: Are you serious?
Michael: I need clean urine for the lady.
Dwight: But that's illegal.
Michael: Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
Dwight: Not my urine.
Michael: A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
Dwight: Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?
Michael: No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
Angela: Do you want to give Michael your urine?
Dwight: I want him to have all the urine he needs.
Angela: You're not going to get my permission on this.
Dwight: I know that. Don't you think I know that?
Linda: Yeah, we do testing all over the country.
Ryan: Cool.  Hey, are you guys hiring?
Linda: You want to work at the urinalysis lab?
Ryan: Yeah.  Maybe.
Dwight: My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.
Pam: What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]
Kevin: I'd like a magazine.
Linda: We just need urine, sir.
Kevin: I'd still like one.
Michael: Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.
Dwight: That's great.
Michael: What's wrong? Where's your costume?
Dwight: It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.
Michael: Why?  Wha...
Dwight: I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
Pam: [placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam]
Jim: Hi.
Pam: Hey.
Jim: How much time do you have left on your break?
Pam: Ten minutes.
Michael: Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.
Dwight: Really?
Michael: Yes, sir.
Dwight: That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .
Michael: So you wanna? Thanks.
Hank: Dwight K. Schrute, I hereby declare you an honorary voluntary corporal in charge of assisting all activities security.
Michael: Okay.
Hank: Here's your badge.
Dwight: Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?
Hank: No, I don't have a gun.
Dwight: Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.
Hank: I don't think so.
Michael: Good.
Dwight: [salutes] Thank you, Michael.
Michael: No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes]
Dwight: I need to go over some details with you.
Michael: Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.
Dwight: First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?
Hank: Two.
Dwight: Oh, God.
Jim: Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?
Jim: [growling] Nice.
Pam: Kevin.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Do someone else.
Jim: Um, [gives Pam a look]
Pam: Angela.
Jim: Whoa.
Pam: The eyebrow.
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: I'm not only hoping to find the culprit who committed this heinous crime, I am praying to find this heinous culprit. And I will pray to Thor himself, if that's what it takes.
Toby: Michael's behavior is erratic and unpredictable, but I don't think he's doing drugs. Maybe he should. Take the edge off. Uh, not at work, of course.
Dwight: People use marijuana to escape. Jim does not have a girlfriend. His sales are nothing to brag about. And he does not belong to any organized clubs. If that were my life, I'd do drugs.
Phyllis: He asked if you've been acting withdrawn lately.
Stanley: And what did you say?
Phyllis: I said no.
Stanley: Hmm.
Phyllis: You're welcome.
Dwight: Your turn, Stanley. [Stanley just takes a drink from his mug] Angela, you're up.
Pam: Last night? Let's see.
Dwight: Go ahead. Don't lie.
Pam: I won't. It's just that last night is really hard for me to remember because I was just a teensy bit high. Should I have not said that?
Dwight: No, no, no. It's okay. Go ahead.
Pam: I know that I shouldn't have done it. But I was in the parking lot at the Quick and Easy.
Dwight: Oh.
Pam: And I took a bong hit from my Bong Water with my pimp.
Dwight: Oh.
Meredith: Pam said you had something important to tell me. Is it bad? Am I getting fired? [Jim shakes head 'no'] Why aren't you telling me? It must be bad. They're taking away my kid. I knew it. [Jim waves arms and shakes head 'no'] They're not taking away my kid. Oh.
Kelly: Oh, sure, I can definitely help you with that. Okay? Please hold.
Dwight: Kelly Kapour. Say your prayers. Let's go. Conference room, pronto. Come on, step it up.
Michael: Drugs are everywhere in our society. They are omniscient. If you look at the amount of pot that was smoked in the United States last year, that would reach the moon.
Oscar: How?
Michael: Exactly. I know. It's amazing.
Oscar: No, how could it reach the moon? Like, would you make it into a rope, or...
Creed: I have some hemp ropes at my house, they're really strong...
Michael: Shut... Shut it. No. Just... Just focus on the facts. Cocaine. They use cocaine.
Dwight: Oh, me? Just one of the gang. Sitting in the back, doodling, not playing attention. Bam! Pow! Surprise! Got you! [Note pad reads, 'Creed -Shifty eyes / Ryan - Dilated pupils / Kelly - Hyperactive'] There's a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy in your midst, and he is taking names.
Michael: One thing that you need to remember is that there's no way of knowing who's a user, who's an abuser, because we don't know. It could be anybody. Your instinct is to say it's somebody-like Stanley or Oscar...
Stanley: Excuse me?
Michael: No, no! Your instinct. That... Your gut reaction is to say that, but I don't! That's, that's... Those are instincts that have been created by media and hype. And they are wrong. What I am saying is that you just do not know who drug users are. It may be the person you least suspect. It may be somebody hot, like Pam, or it could be somebody matronly, like Phyllis, but just not me.
Phyllis: It's not me, either.
Michael: No? okay, fine.
Jan: [on the phone] Michael, I'm gonna get going. I really don't think I need to be in this meeting.
Michael: Okay, well, I really think that... [dial tone beeping]
Pam: Has she been on the phone the whole time?
Michael: Yeah. Sorry you had to hear that. It was a lovers' quarrel.
Dwight: Make-up sex. Nice!
Kevin: Nice.
Michael: Okay, let's get personal for a second, shall we?
Dwight: The scary thing is, it could have been any one of these people. They all had a motive. To get high.
Michael: Okay, well, I made up some fliers for everybody to take on your way out, in case you're ever tempted. So there you go. And, Dwight, you know, I'm very busy today. It wasn't even planning on going to the bathroom, so I don't even know if anything will come out.
Dwight: just drink a lot of water.
Michael: Well...
Dwight: You have to relax your muscles around the bladder.
Michael: I don't... Let's just not talk about it, okay?
Pam: [reading from Michael's flier] 'Drugs: Let's not and say we did.' I think Michael was high when he wrote this.
Toby: You know, sometimes I wish we just didn't have a conference room. [Kelly laughs] You know? He couldn't do that.
Kelly: But then we wouldn't have any meetings.
Toby: Yeah.
Kelly: Okay. Bye, Toby.
Toby: Bye.
Kelly: Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Hello? Yes, I am so, so sorry. Yeah, actually, I don't have that information just yet. Uh-huh. Listen, do you mind if I put you on a brief hold? Okay.
Angela: I look forward to drug testing. I used to get a runner's high, which is why now I swim.
Meredith: Why would I be worried? I'm not a drug user. I would never abuse my body like that. I mean, they are plenty of other ways to have fun. My body is 100% drug-free.
Pam: [telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Um, hold, please. [to Jim] There's a Brenda on the phone for you. [to Brenda] Just one second, I'll transfer.
Jim: [telephone ringing] [shows note to camera 'It's OK. She'll call back!']
Man: She's got it up now.
Sheriff: He'll be up. Okay, sure. I'll get someone down.
Dwight: Hey. Hey. Jerry.
Sheriff: Thanks.
Dwight: Sheriff Pierce? I'm turning in my badge.
Sheriff: Where sis you get that?
Dwight: I got it here.
Sheriff: No. No, you didn't. we didn't give you this.
Dwight: No, I mean at the gift shop. Also, I can't wear this anymore.
Sheriff: You were never supposed to wear this in the first place, Dwight. Come on now, seriously, you got me concerned here a little bit.
Dwight: Oh, don't worry. I never abused my power. I only tried to help the Sheriff's Department in any way I could.
Sheriff: Right, well... Why don't you give me a couple examples of ways that you've helped us out?
Dwight: Oh, God, there are so many. Roadside assistance, breaking up unruly parties, surveillance...
Sheriff: Surveillance?
Dwight: Crowd control, directing traffic...
Sheriff: Mace! You... You've been carrying around weapons-grade Mace?
Dwight: I've only had to use it once.
Vance Refrigeration Worker #1: [tosses the butt of a joint in parking lot] We should get a pizza.
Vance Refrigeration Worker #2: I hate pizza.
Kevin: So, uh... you found a band for your wedding yet?
Pam: No.
Kevin: Cause I'm in a band. We really rock.
Jim: Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.
Phyllis: Oh I got the 'Save The Date'.
Pam: Yeah?
Phyllis: Yeah, pretty stationery.
Pam: Oh, thanks!
Angela: I didn't get mine yet.
Pam: Uh...
Pam: There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.
Michael: Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.
Phyllis: Uh, on or off?
I.D. Photographer: Off.
Phyllis: Okay... [removes glasses]
Dwight: Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Phyllis: [leaving the room] Excuse me.
Dwight: Clown paint.
Dwight: I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?
Michael: That's a nice tie.
Ryan: Thank you.
Michael: That is... who makes that?
Ryan: Um, I don't...
Michael: Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
Ryan: Um...  let's um, let's keep our clothes.
Oscar: It's like child abuse. I say, if Jesus saw that, he'd freak out! He'd freak out, Toby! I mean on some levels... it's... and I'm supposed to work there. I'm supposed...
Michael: [walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?
Toby: Just letting Oscar vent a little. We would use the break room, but the photographer's back there today.
Michael: What's the problem?
Oscar: Angela!
Toby: It's just a little dispute over a poster in their workspace.
Oscar: Since Christmas.
Michael: So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
Oscar: No.
Toby: Michael, can I talk to you for a uh, second please?
Michael: Yes.
Toby: Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.
Michael: Yeah?
Toby: These things just have a way of working themselves out.
Michael: Okay.
Toby: It's like if you write someone a letter, when you're really angry... they say to keep it in a drawer for a couple days. Then you just never end up sending it.
Michael: What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
Toby: Okay.
Michael: Okay... what?
Toby: That was the right decision for me and my marriage.
Michael: Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
Michael: [holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.
Angela: Can we go? I have a lot of work to do.
Michael: No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Oscar: What's the next one?
Michael: Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
Angela: Can we just skip to whatever number 5 is - win/win or whatever?
Michael: Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
Michael: [in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.
Angela: I got this poster for Christmas, and I feel I want to see it everyday. It makes me feel like the babies are the true artists, and God has a really cute sense of humor.
Michael: Come on, seriously, that?
Oscar: I don't like looking at it. It's creepy, and in bad taste, and it's just offensive to me. It makes me think of the horrible, frigid stage mothers who force the babies into it. It's kitsch. It's the opposite of art. It destroys art. It destroys souls. This is so much more offensive to me than hardcore porno. I'm talking about the...
Michael: Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
Pam: Win!
Michael: Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
Oscar: No.
Angela: That's... no...
Michael: Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
Angela: How about, I leave it up?
Oscar: How 'bout, she takes it down?
Pam: How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Michael: Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
Pam: Win.
Oscar: Fine.
Angela: But, it...
Michael: [claps his hands twice] It is done!
Pam: Win
Photographer: [snaps a photo of Creed, then Creed turns to the side for a profile shot] No, you're all good.
Creed: Great. [gets up and leaves]
Pam: Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.
Angela: Oh. Thanks.
Angela: It was hand delivered. But, I did get a Save The Date after all. It's not my taste.
Toby: You solved it?
Michael: Yes.
Toby: Well, good.  We can, uh, throw that one out. [shuffles through papers]
Michael: Are those all the other complains?
Toby: Mmm-Hm.
Michael: I would like to see those please.
Toby: I... I can't do that.
Michael: You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
Toby: That... [shakes head and places hand over the file]
Michael: Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?
Toby: [sighs and pulls out a box under his desk] It's all Dwight's.
Toby: Every Friday at 4, I have a standing appointment with Dwight for him to file a grievance against Jim. I tell him that I'm sending them to a special file in New York. That box is the special file in New York.
Michael: Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?
Photographer: Are you sure? [looks at Oscar, who is front of the camera, holding the baby poster in front of his chest]
Dwight: Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
Photographer: [shoots twice]
Michael: [looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.
Pam: Nice.
Michael: You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Toby: Actually, I have a separate folder for complaints against Michael. This [unlocks a drawer]is January through March of this year. [pulls out a fairly large folder]
Michael: How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?
Angela: You already did me.
Michael: That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?
Toby: Yeah, it just means whoever complained came to me later and withdrew it, so I took their name off.
Michael: Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
Dwight: Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
Pam: [notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?
Michael: All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Pam: Wait, what did it say?
Michael: Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
Pam: I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!
Michael: Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.
Ryan: My voicemail's really spotty... sometimes...
Kelly: I didn't file a complaint. I was just talking.
Toby: To your HR representative.
Kelly: To my friend, I thought. I want that withdrawn.
Toby: Fine, I'll take your name off. [looks at Michael] So no one will know.
Michael: [crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?
Jim: Dwight tried to kiss me.
Michael: What?!
Jim: And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Dwight: That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
Jim: Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
Dwight: Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
Toby: Sure.
Michael: Stanley. [off camera]
Pam: [gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!
Michael: [still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
Anglea: I didn't do it! [Michael and Stanley continue to talk off camera, but it's inaudible]
Pam: I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.
Michael: Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.
Stanley: I didn't say that.
Creed: Then why is there a picture of a white man on the door? [Michael, along with the camera, look at the standard stick man on the bathroom door.]
Michael: Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
Phyllis: No, I never said any such thing. Angela and I are close.
Michael: And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Phyllis: Stanley and I are close, too.
Stanley: We sit close.
Michael: Oh... ok.
Toby: [sits down for his ID picture] Just take it. [flashes goes off, while he is standing back up again]
Pam: I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.
Jim: Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Pam: Don't take her side.
Jim: [sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Pam: I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.
Jim: You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Yeah...
Phyllis: I know you keep saying it's your space, even though there's no assigned parking, but I keep forgetting.
Angela: Yes, that's the problem.
Phyllis: I guess so...
Michael: Okay, well... all settled, then.
Phyllis: [whispering to Angela] I don't like you.
Michael: OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?
Creed: I know exactly what he's talking about. I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk drawer. Very nutritious. But they smell like death.
Michael: All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.
Kevin: I accept your decision!
Jim: Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.
Dwight: That doesn't make any sense.
Jim: Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
Photographer: [to Dwight, who is sitting in front of the camera] Smile.
Dwight: No.
Dwight: I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.
Jim: This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.
Dwight: This is humongous. I am not a security threat...
Jim: Oh.
Dwight: And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
Jim: What did I write?
Dwight: I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.
Toby: Talk to Michael. I gave him the box.
Dwight: What box?!
Phyllis: But I didn't report your snoring-
Stanley: Wednesdays, tearful. Tuesdays... [Dwight walks in and rummages through his complaint box]
Michael: Uh. Dwight.
Dwight: Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
Michael: Okay! Calm down.
Dwight: No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Michael: Hey, hey!
Dwight: Him or me?
Michael: Stop.
Dwight: Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Michael: Okay...
Dwight: Either he goes, or I go.
Michael: Dwight...
Dwight: You choose!
Michael: Stop...
Dwight: One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out]
Michael: Oh... kay...
Dwight: I am not bluffing!
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Okay?
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: I deserve this. You know I do!
Michael: [picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Dwight: You have till five.
Dwight: Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!
Michael: Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Michael: Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.
Michael: Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'
Jim: [laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.
Michael: [reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'
Jim: That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.
Michael: [reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'
Jim: Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.
Michael: By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'
Jim: Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.
Michael: The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.
Jim: Maybe Stanford would be cool.
Dwight: It's a good market. Higher volume.
Jim: Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
Dwight: I have a girlfriend...
Jim: Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.
Michael: Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.
Dwight: So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Michael: Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
Dwight: I want an answer by tomorrow.
Michael: Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?
Dwight: Fine.
Michael: Good. Okay.
Michael: Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?
Photographer: I can't. I only get reimbursed for the I.D. photos.
Michael: Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
Photographer: You mean digital?
Michael: It'll take like two seconds.
Photographer: 20 bucks.
Michael: Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
Stanley: You gotta be kiddin' me.
Michael: Come on, everybody.
Dwight: Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
Photographer: One, two, three... smile. [camera flashes, but no one smiles] Try to smile.
Michael: We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
Photographer: Alright, I'm just gonna take it on three...  whether you smile or not. One, two, three. [camera flashes]
Michael: Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
Photographer: That'll be another 20.
Michael: What?
Pam: Angela, I want to talk to you about something.
Michael: [off camera] You just press the button.
Angela: What?
Jim: No, Pam.
Pam: [looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.
Jim: Pam, it wasn't her.
Pam: What?!
Jim: I'm the one who complained about you.
Jim: I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.
Michael: [off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.
Jim: You know, it was one day.
Michael: [off camera] That's terrible.
Jim: And I took it right back. It was like...
Pam: Okay.
Phyllis: Oh, dear.
Michael: [off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]
Michael: It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.
Michael: [flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?
Michael: But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.
Jim: [on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]
Female worker: Okay, Jan will see you now.
Jim: Oh, thanks.
Michael: And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.
Dwight: [elevator bell dings] What is this? What happened here?
Jim: I don't know.
Dwight: Oh, this does not look good. Did anyone see what happened around my desk area this morning?
Jim: Dwight, I really think someone's probably just playing a prank on you, so just go right through it.
Dwight: A prank, huh? This is official police line tape, okay? It's not a prank.
Jim: Probably is.
Dwight: Damn it, people! Someone must have seen something! [Jim's cell phone beeping] Oh, you people are useless. Jesus.
Pam: [telephone ringing] Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Hold, please. Dwight, it's the Sheriff. He said that it's really important. It's regarding your desk. I'll transfer.
Dwight: Oh, no, no, don't! I can't... [groans] [telephone ringing]
Jim: Just cut through it, man, it's no big deal.
Dwight: This is why I'm a Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy and you're not.
Jim: That is not why. Wow, man, he really wants to get in touch with you. Maybe it's a murder.
Dwight: No, there's no blood.
Jim: Maybe poison?
Dwight: Possibly.
Jim: My God!
Dwight: [exclaiming in fear] No, Jim, no! [Jim knocks Dwight's phone off its cradle] [yelling toward the phone] Sheriff, this is Volunteer Sheriff's Deputy Dwight Schrute. Press the pound key! What's your 20?
Michael: Nothing much is happening today. We are having our photo IDs taken. Whoop-de-doo. Can't always be like The Apprentice.
Ryan: I know.
Michael: On Big Brother, something important happens every day. But real life is not like that.
Photographer: [Dwight slurping] Okay, here we go. One, two...
Dwight: He sometimes wears glasses, write that down. Also, that may not be his real hair.
Michael: I hate it when people don't tell each other why they're angry. My dad was like that. I would say, 'What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad? What's wrong, Dad?' Over and over and over. And he would just look at me like I was an idiot.
Dwight: I'm the one who petitioned the office board to have these ID badges taken.
Photographer: So there were no death threats?
Dwight: Let me see your ID.
Michael: There is this old story about two women who each think they are the mother of this baby. And they can't decide, so they bring the baby to a wise man. Just like a manager in those days. And the wise man says, 'I will adopt this baby and raise it as a Hindu.' See? They didn't expect that. And that fixed it. Because I think he was the dad anyway.
Michael: There are dozens of old complaints in here. Cold cases, like the show. [imitating gonging] And Toby is a lazy detective who has decided that these armed robberies and rapes and murder/suicides are not important enough to solve. Well, you know what? I have a problem with that. And I'm going to open up these cases before Toby can kill or rape another person.
Photographer: All right.
Pam: That's not bad. Hey, do you do weddings?
Photographer: Would you seriously want your wedding photos to look like that?
Jim: Not bad.
Dwight: I gave her a higher clearance than you.
Jim: What does Level Red mean?
Dwight: I'd tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. [laughing maniacally]
Meredith: Wait. [puts eye drops in] [Photographer takes the shot and her eyes are  closed]
Kevin: No, wait. [put on a hat] Yeah.
Phyllis: You must have misdialed. This is Phyllis. No, I'm not sure what his extension is. [glares at Stanley as he glares right back]
Michael: Wow! I never thought Dwight would go postal. It's always the person you least expect and I always thought Dwight would go postal.
Phyllis: Come on, Dwight, I think it's actually healthy to get it off your chest.
Dwight: I'm done talking. I am a Schrute. We don't back down.
Phyllis: You're arrogant and pompous, and I don't like you.
Michael: Cage Match'? I don't know if it was in the packet from corporate, because I barely read any of it. So if you're asking if I stole their idea, the answer is no.
Hank the Security Guard: Excuse me, sir! Dwight Schrute, is that your real name?
Dwight: Yes, sir.
Kevin: Morning.
Hank the Security Guard: Good morning. Okay, go ahead.
Dwight: Thank you. [elevator door closes] No, come on... God!
Michael: Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.
Jim: Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?
Dwight: I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Pam: It's a nice tux.
Dwight: I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
Roy: So, what's the deal? We gotta pay for our own drinks? That's lame.
Pam: Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.
Dwight: Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
Jim: I can always kind of win at roulette.
Dwight: Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: How would you do that?
Jim: Mind control.
Dwight: [laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?
Jim: Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
Dwight: I don't believe you. Continue.
Jim: It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Dwight: [scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
Jim: Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]
Dwight: Oh, my God.
Michael: I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.
Jan: [on phone] Yeah, but... Well, the fact of the matter is that your branch is currently number four of the five branches that I oversee.
Michael: Top 80 percent!
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Yeah?
Jan: You know that I'm very serious here.
Michael: Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Jan: What?
Michael: Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
Jan: I thought that you were their fearless leader.
Michael: I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Jan: [laughs] I think you can handle it.
Michael: Oh, come on. Come on.
Jan: I think so, Michael...
Michael: You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
Jan: Goodbye, Michael.
Michael: Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.
Michael: Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.
Oscar: Again? We do that every year.
Michael: Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Oscar: It'd be nice to do something for people who are actually suffering.
Michael: Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Jim: That doesn't exist anymore.
Michael: Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
Pam: No, they stopped making that show.
Michael: Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
Angela: You have to pick an approved, non-profit organization.
Creed: There's a great soup kitchen in downtown Scranton. Delicious pea soup on Thursdays. I'll probably give the money to them.
Kevin: Something with animals. Or people.
Kelly: Kobe Bryant has a foundation, and he is
Angela: We are giving money that has been gambled. Why don't we just deal drugs or prostitute ourselves,  and donate that money to charity?
Michael: Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...
Toby: Actually, I didn't think it was appropriate to invite children since it's... You know, there's gambling and alcohol, and it's in our dangerous warehouse and it's a school night... And, you know, Hooters is catering. You know, is that enough? Should I keep going?
Michael: Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
Jim: I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.
Michael: No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
Phyllis: Afghani.
Michael: What?
Phyllis: Afghani.
Michael: That's a dog.
Pam: No, that's Afghan.
Michael: That's a shawl.
Dwight: Wait, canine AIDS?
Michael: No. Humans with AIDS.
Creed: Who has AIDS?
Jim: Guys, the Afghanistananies.
Michael: Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
Michael: There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.
Jim: What are you doing?
Pam: Oh, nothing.
Jim: Till Death Do Us Rock.'
Pam: They're wedding bands.
Jim: Oh.
Pam: Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.
Jim: Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.
Pam: There's a KISS cover band in here.
Jim: Let's do it.
Pam: I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.
Jim: Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.
Michael: I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?
Darryl: Mike, I am not having fire-eaters in a paper warehouse.
Michael: It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
Darryl: Except my warehouse.
Michael: Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
Dwight: Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.
Michael: Why are you here?
Dwight: When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.
Michael: Not. I said, not that.
Darryl: We just have a lot of stuff down there that could be stolen.
Michael: That's ironic.
Darryl: What?
Michael: That you are afraid.
Darryl: Why? 'Cause I'm from the hood?
Michael: Dinkin' flicka.
Darryl: [sighs] Dinkin' flicka.
Darryl: I taught Mike some, uh, phrases to help with his interracial conversations. You know, stuff like, 'Fleece it out.' 'Going mach five.' 'Dinkin' flicka.' You know, things us Negroes say.
Michael: Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture]
Darryl: Oh, yeah, I taught him a handshake, too.
Jim: [Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.
Pam: I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.
Jim: Yes.
Pam: Have three stages, yeah.
Jim: Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
Pam: Oh.
Jim: Let's take a look. Nice.
Pam: Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.
Jim: What?
Pam: On the drums! On the drums!
Jim: Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
Kevin: We really don't do a lot of weddings. We actually don't play in public very often. We are all really hoping that Pam's wedding works out. This could be a turning point for the band.
Jim: Wow. Oh!
Pam: Oh, my...
Jim: Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
Pam: No! No!
Jim: No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Pam: No, come back! No, no, no!
Jim: Kev!
Pam: Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.
Michael: [phone rings] Yes
Pam: [phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.
Michael: Who?
Pam: Carol Stills.
Michael: Do I know a Carol Stills?
Pam: Your realtor.
Michael: Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it
Pam: It's still me.
Pam: Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.
Pam: Carol, you're on with Michael.
Carol: [on phone] Hello, Michael?
Michael: Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Carol: I'm great. I just needed one last signature for your mortgage insurance.
Michael: Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Carol: Oh, great.
Michael: Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
Carol: Oh, good, I'm glad. Can I drop it over later?
Michael: Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Carol: Oh, great.
Michael: Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Carol: To the casino thing?
Michael: Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...
Carol: What?
Michael: Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Pam: Michael, Jan's on line two.
Michael: Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?
Pam: It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Hey, Jan. How you doing?
Jan: You know, I... I thought about it and you are right.
Michael: I am?
Jan: I could use a little fun. So, I am going to drive up for your Casino Night.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jan: Incidentally, what is the charity?
Michael: AIDS.
Jan: Okay, then. I will see you tonight.
Michael: Okay, sounds great.
Jan: Bye-bye.
Michael: Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Carol: No problemo.
Michael: Right.
Carol: To answer your question...
Michael: Yeah?
Carol: Yes.
Michael: What?
Carol: I'd love to go.
Michael: Okay.
Carol: I have to get a sitter, but that shouldn't be a problem.
Michael: Problem. Good.
Carol: And I'll bring the papers, too.
Michael: Good, All right. Sounds great.
Carol: I'll see you tonight.
Michael: Bye.
Carol: Bye.
Michael: Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Pam: [People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!
Roy: Yeah! That's great.
Michael: Hey, hey.
Carol: Hi.
Michael: Hey, Carol.
Carol: Hi.
Michael: You look great.
Carol: Thanks. Thank you for inviting me. It looks so great in here.
Michael: Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]
Dwight: Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Dwight: I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'
Michael: Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.
Carol: Drink would be good.
Michael: Okay.
Creed: Oh, I steal things all the time. It's just something I do. I stopped caring a long time ago. You should see how many supplies I've taken from this place. Honestly, I love stealing things.
Billy's Girlfriend: I'm gonna get a drink. Do you need anything?
Billy: No, I'm fine. Thank's sweetheart.
Billy's Girlfriend: Okay.
Michael: Billy, your nurse is hot.
Billy: That's my girlfriend.
Michael: Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Billy: She was never my nurse. I met her at Chili's. She was my waitress.
Michael: Chili's is great.
Michael: Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.
Stanley: [Under his breath] Will Lady Fortune give me a raise?
Michael: Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
Dealer: Okay, the game is No-Limit Texas Hold'em. Good luck, everybody. That's at least four red chips to you, sir.
Michael: All-in. [Other players fold their hands]
Michael: Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?
Toby: I'll call.
Michael: What are... That's insane.
Toby: I have good cards.
Michael: Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
Dealer: No, I'm sorry. He can't, sir. He's gone all-in.
Michael: Okay, all right, whatever.
Dealer: Flip them.
Michael: You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves]
Meredith: Wow.
Toby: I don't really play cards, but I'm not gonna lie to you. It felt really good to take money from Michael. Gonna chase that feeling.
Dwight: I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.
Jim: [coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.
Jim: It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.
Carol: Wow, bad luck.
Michael: Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Jan.
Jan: Hi.
Michael: Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
Jan: What are you... Just... Wait, what're you talking about?
Carol: What does that mean?
Michael: After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
Jan: No. No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Jan. I'm Michael's boss.
Carol: Hi, hi.
Jan: Does anyone want a drink?
Carol: No, I'm good.
Jan: Okay. [Carol stares at Michael]
Michael: Um...
Dwight: Hey, hey.
Michael: Hey. What...
Dwight: Jan's here.
Dwight: Give me the dice.
Kevin: Come on, Dwight.
Dwight: Let's go.
Billy: It's all on you, baby. Let's go.
Angela: Good evening, Dwight. What is this?
Dwight: Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins.
Kevin: Yes.
Angela: Then roll an eight.
Dwight: Thank you, Angela.
Angela: Good luck, Dwight.
Dwight: Yeah! Yeah! [Kisses Angela, she slaps him and walks away smiling]
Kevin: Dwight, let's keep it going. Let's keep it going. Let's go.
Oscar: Let it ride. Let it all ride.
Dwight: Give me the dice!
Jim: Yeah, right.
Pam: Yeah, right,' what?
Jim: What was this? [Makes face]
Pam: [Laughs] I have good cards.
Jim: Really?
Pam: Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.
Jim: Wow. I think you're bluffing.
Kevin: Yeah, I think she's full of it.
Pam: Straight.
Jim: Oh. Three nines.
Kevin: Pam. Jim Halpert, ladies and gentlemen.
Jim: Thank you very much. It was fun.
Jan: Cosmopolitan, please.
Carol: Can I get a red wine? So, two hours? That's a long drive.
Jan: Well, it's part of the job, you know? Keep an eye on things. So... Why not? So, how long have you and Michael been...
Carol: Oh, well, actually, I guess this would be our first date. I guess.
Jan: Casino Night in the warehouse. Good sport.
Carol: Well, I'm having a nice time.
Jan: Oh, me too. Me too.
Ryan: One beer and one Seven and Seven with eight maraschino cherries, sugar on the rim, blended if you can.
Jim: So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Michael: All right!
Dealer: The point is four. Shooter, roll it. Four!
Dwight: Come on, shooter!
Michael: Four! [Holds dice in front of Carol] Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites. [Holds dice in front of Jan] All right, here we go!
Carol: All right.
Michael: Yeah!
Dealer: Five.
Michael: So close. So close.
Dwight: Come on. [Turns to Jan] So where you staying? Radisson?
Jan: What?
Dwight: Super 8?
Jan: No, I...
Dwight: Motel 6? Best Western?
Jan: I didn't... I don't know...
Dwight: Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
Kevin: I won the 2002 $2,500 No-Limit Deuce-to-Seven-Draw Tournament at the World Series of Poker in Vegas. So, yeah... I'm pretty good at poker.
Kevin: All-in.
Phyllis: Okay, let's do it.
Bob Vance: Good Luck, honey.
Phyllis: Oh, thank you, Bobby. But it doesn't matter, it's just fun to play.
Kevin: Three queens.
Dwight: Nice, very nice.
Phyllis: I have an ace.
Oscar: No, that's a flush.
Dwight: Oh, man!
Phyllis: Oh, I have a flush!
Bob: Yes!
Phyllis: Look, I won! Look I have all the clovers! You wanna play again?
Kevin: I suck.
Roy: She took you down, huh?
Kevin: I do not want to talk about it.
Roy: Hey, I saw your tape. Your band, Scrantonicity? You guys rock.
Kevin: Yeah?
Roy: Yeah, you guys wanna play our wedding?
Kevin: Awesome. Did Pam say it was okay?
Roy: Whatever. I'm in charge of the music.
Kevin: Dude, you will not be sorry.
Roy: Sweet. All right.
Kevin: All right.
Jan: Smoke?
Jim: No, thanks. You having fun?
Jan: Fabulous time. I drove two and a half hours to get here.
Jim: Yeah, we all really...
Jan: Left work early, drove down here. And I am completely underdressed
Jim: Well, I think you look great.
Jan: Why did I hook up with Michael?
Jim: Yeah, why did you?
Jan: It was very late, Jim. Very... Very late and... Have you given any more thought to the transfer?
Jim: Oh, yeah.
Jan: Good. Have you told anyone?
Jim: No.
Jan: Well, you should.
Bob: Excuse me. Big moment. The evening's chip leader and winner of this beautiful mini-refrigerator courtesy of Vance Refrigeration, Creed Bratton, Dunder Mifflin!
Creed: Thanks. I never owned a refrigerator.
Roy: Sorry, babe. I am just beat.
Pam: It's okay. I'll see you at home.
Roy: Okay. Hey, don't try to lose too much money, all right?
Pam: Okay.
Roy: If you still want a honeymoon. Hey, Halpert. Keep an eye on her, all right?
Jim: Okay, will do.
Roy: See you.
Pam: Bye! Hey.
Jim: Hey, how's it going?
Pam: Good, especially after I took all your money in poker.
Jim: Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Pam: About when you want to give me more of your money?
Jim: No, I...
Pam: Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.
Jim: I was just... I'm in love with you.
Pam: What?
Jim: I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
Pam: What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?
Jim: I just needed you to know. Once.
Pam: Well, I um... I... I can't.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: You have no idea...
Jim: Don't do that.
Pam: ...what your friendship means to me.
Jim: Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be
Pam: I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.
Jim: Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Jan: Hey. I'm leaving.
Michael: Hey, okay.
Jan: So, I just wanted to congratulate you on a fantastic evening. You did the company proud.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: And thanks for inviting me. You were right, I needed it. So, thanks.
Michael: Okay. Thanks for coming.
Jan: Nice to meet you.
Carol: You, too.
Jan: And you guys have a good time together.
Michael: Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Jan: Yeah.
Carol: Goodbye.
Michael: Good night. She's a good boss.
Carol: She seems really nice.
Michael: Oh, she's great.
Michael: Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.
Pam: [On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]
Michael: Everybody, in the conference room now, please. Thank you. Time is money.
Dwight: Do you need anything?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Should I get water or donuts?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Come on, let's go. Take a seat.
Oscar: What's going on, Michael?
Michael: I want somebody to give me the name of one of our biggest competitors.
Dwight: Office Depot!
Michael: Good. Yes, that will work. All right. Now I need a plural noun. [All groaning]
Pam: Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.
Michael: How about a location?
Dwight: The planet Caprica.
Michael: Where the hell is that?
Dwight: It's from Battlestar Galactica.
Michael: Okay, all right.
Stanley: I am going back to my desk...
Michael: No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
Stanley: Annoying.
Michael: We already have that. So...
Toby: Frustrating.
Michael: No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
Phyllis: Ass.
Michael: Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'
Dwight: Yeah, get them, Creed!
Michael: One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.
Dwight: My charity is the Farm Defense Fund. It's one of the best organizations that fights infestation of the beet armyworm.
Jim: My charity is the Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's Department, because Dwight's a Volunteer Sheriff. So I thought this was a perfect opportunity to support/mock him.
Dwight: I don't believe that Jim moved that coat rack. But if he did, he has an obligation to use his gift wisely. With great power comes great responsibility. They could do a cross-section of his brain to find out more. But I don't think it's true, though.
Michael: Look, if anything goes missing, we will reimburse.
Darryl: Yeah. Can Dunder Mifflin afford that?
Michael: Dang! Paper making paper, I.e. money.
Darryl: What?
Michael: Paper money. [clears throat] Yeah. The company's doing fine.
Darryl: Mike, we're not shipping as much as we did last year.
Michael: Hey. Okay. You know what? Don't even think. I command you to just go down and have fun tonight. All right? Don't think about it.
Michael: Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.
Pam: It is extremely stressful, planning a wedding by yourself. It's like a job. I mean, it's fun, but it kind of becomes like work. I've already planned it all out in my head. But it's just in my head.
Meredith's Vet: Hey. Meredith, right?
Meredith: Oh, God. Oh, no. I have this problem all the time. I never remember people I've had sex with.
Meredith's Vet: I'm your vet.
Meredith: Oh, right.
Meredith's Vet: And we had sex in the parking lot.
Jim: [Dressed as Dwight] It's kind of blurry. [puts on his glasses] That's better. [exhales] Question.  What kind of bear is best?
Dwight: That's a ridiculous question.
Jim: False.  Black bear.
Dwight: Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
Jim: Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
Dwight: Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
Jim: Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses.  Uh, four dollars.  And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble.  And that's a grand total of... [Jim calculates the total on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.
Dwight: You know what?  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you. [Jim places a bobble-head on his desk]  Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!  Millions of families suffer every year!
Jim: ... MICHAEL!
Dwight: Oh, that's funny.  MICHAEL!
Pam: [on phone] Yes, I understand.  Can I transfer you to customer relations?
Jim: [on phone] Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
Phyllis: [on phone] I know, I know.  We're all trying to get to the bottom of this.
Stanley: [on phone] I am upset.  Don't I sound upset?
Michael: [on phone] It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
Michael: We have a crisis.  Apparently, a disgruntled employee at the paper mill decided that it would be funny to put an obscene watermark on our 24 pound cream butter stock.  Five hundred boxes has gone out, with the image of a beloved cartoon duck, performing...  unspeakable acts upon a certain cartoon mouse that a lot of people like.  I've never been a fan.
Michael: Everybody in here.  STAT.  No time to lose.  Cri-Man-Squa.  F and C, doubletime.
Dwight: Cri-Man-Squa?
Michael: Crisis Management Squad.
Ryan: F and C, doubletime?
Michael: Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
Jim: One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Michael: To save time, Jim.
Karen: Actually I think you could make the argument that it wastes time.
Pam: Yeah, she has a good point.  I mean, for example, with the last thing you said, by the time you explained it, it actually took up more time.
Michael: You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
Creed: Here.
Michael: Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
Creed: Every week I'm supposed to take four hours and do a quality spot-check at the paper mill.  And of course the one year I blow it off, this happens.
Michael: We have a lot of angry customers out there.  This puts us at threat level midnight.  Accounting, you are on customer service duty today.
Oscar: That's really not our job.
Michael: Midnight, Oscar!
Angela: Kelly's training us?
Kelly: This day is bananas. B-A-N-A-N-A-S.  This
Angela: [getting a pill from the bottle] I don't have a headache.  I'm just preparing.
Michael: Jim, big fire in your house.  Your client, Dunmore High-school, sent out their prom invitations on this paper.  Went home to all the kids.
Jim: Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
Michael: No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
Jim: All right.
Michael: I want you to bring a partner.
Ryan: I'll go.
Michael: No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
Andy: [English accent] William Dolittle at your service.  A.K.A., Will Do.
Jim: Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
Michael: No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
Dwight: Yes!  You are entering the 'No Spin Zone!'
Pam: We're having a press conference?
Michael: No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
Dwight: Not! [scoffs]
Michael: Here's the thing.  When a company screws up, best thing to do is call a press conference.  Alert the media, and then you control the story.  Wait for them to find out, and the story controls you.  That's what happened to O.J.
Michael: I have invited Barbara Allen, one of our oldest clients, to come in here, and meet with me, for a personal apology.  The press wants a story, I will give them a story.
Jim: Oh, did the press ask for a story?
Michael: Here
Creed: Yes, hello.  Creed Bratton, Quality Assurance, Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  I was supposed to meet with one of your floor managers last week for a quality inspection, and he or she wasn't there.  And I'm trying to remember who it was.  Mm-hmm.  Who wasn't there last week?  Debbie Brown.  And which day was that?  Wednesday, the eleventh.  Perfect.
Creed: The only difference between me and a homeless man is this job.  I will do whatever it takes to survive.  Like I did... when I was a homeless man.
Kelly: Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you're not good at interacting with people.  But guess what?  From now on, you guys are no longer losers!  So give yourselves a round of applause.  [Kelly and Kevin clap]
Oscar: I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer calls.
Kelly: I know, right?  Probably a lot.
Angela: Can you just tell us what we need to do so we can go?
Kelly: OK, Angela.  I love your enthusiasm.  All you need to know how to do is pick up the phone and say 'Customer Service, this is Kelly!'  Except don't say 'Kelly,' say your own name.  Or if you're bored, you can just make up a name.  Like one time, I said I was Bridget Jones, [in an English accent] and I talked like this for the whole conversation!
Kevin: Oh! Can I be [horrible Australian accent] Australian, mate?
Kelly: [in accent] Absolutely!
Kevin: [in accent] 'ello, mate!
Kelly: [in accent] I like ice cream!  I need a boyfriend.
Kevin: [in accent] I like ice cream too, mate.  Alligators and dingo babies.
Andy: Beer me!
Jim: What's that?
Andy: Hand me that water.  I always say 'Beer me.'  Gets a laugh like a quarter of the time.  So how's what's-her-name?
Jim: You know her name.
Andy: Who, Karen?  Yeah, she's only one of my oldest friends.  [takes swig of water] Mmm.  How's the apartment hangin'?
Jim: It's fine.
Andy: Nice.  Check out this sunshine, man.  Global warming, right?  Today was supposed to be really cold, I bet.
Jim: What about music?  Do you have any music?
Andy: Uh, yeah.  Should have said so.  [sings] Rha-dah-dah-dah!  Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul.  I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away-he-hay.  Ruu-da-doo-da-doo, ba-dit-da-doo-da-dun, Give me the beat, boys, and free my little-ole-soul, I wa--
Jim: I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
Andy: Your call, dude.  My girlfriend made an awesome mix.  Beer me that disc.
Jim: Lord, beer me strength.
Andy: So, Tuna.  When we get in there, let's do a really good job, okay?
Jim: Did that
Andy: Well not everything a guy says needs to be said.  Sometimes it's just about the music of the conversation.
Andy: Whoa!  What the--- Why is my girlfriend here?
Jim: Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Andy: No, she's a part-time frozen yogurt chef.
Jim: Which one... is she?
Andy: The one in the green hoodie.
Jim: Wow.
Andy: I wonder if she's, like, a... a guidance counselor, or something?
Jim: No, I don't think so.
Andy: She's like, probably a tutor.
Jim: Nope.
Andy: She probably a t--
Jim: No.
Andy: Sh---
Jim: No.
Michael: OK, press conference in 45.  Dwight, make sure this place looks nice.
Dwight: On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
Dwight: First rule in road-side beet sales: Put the most attractive beets on top.  The ones that make you pull the car over and go, 'Wow, I need this beet right now.'  Those are the money beets.
Dwight: [Chad Lite walks in the door] [to Office workers] Hey!  [snaps twice] Look sharp!  [to Chad Lite] Hey!  Uh, Hi.  Hello, Dwight Schrute.
Chad Lite: Hi, uh---
Dwight: And you must be uh, from the Washington Post.
Chad Lite: Scranton Times.  Chad Lite, 'Lighter Side of Life.'
Dwight: And 'Breaking Corporate News.'
Chad Lite: And obits.
Dwight: Oh, dear God.  OK, here are your credentials.  You've been granted level three security clearance.
Chad Lite: Oh...
Dwight: Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?
Chad Lite: Uh, yeah, I'd like uh, uh---
Dwight: [shuts door on him] Great.
Jim: Oh, Andy.  You know what?  We don't have a
Andy: Jamie!
Jim: Andy--- Ohh...
Andy: What are you doing here?
Jamie: Andy?
Andy: Are you a student here?
Jamie: Oh... yeah...
Andy: You never told me you were in high-school!
Jamie: This is weird.  I... gotta go to Spanish.
Andy: OH MY GOD!
Jim: Oh my God.
Andy: I had no idea.
Jim: Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Andy: Huh... We didn't do anything illegal.  Except knock over a mailbox with her friends.
Kevin: [on phone] Sir, yes, you have a valid point.  I'm sorry.  No, I am
Oscar: [on phone] Really, Dixon City? ...Carbondale.
Angela: [on phone] Excuse me?  Well, I don't see how that's our fault.  And I've already told you, the official position of Dunder Mifflin is apologetic, so I don't know what you want from me. [hangs up]
Kelly: OK, first, I just wanna say that you are doing
Creed: When I went over Wednesday, for the spot-check, I got a call from Debbie Brown, saying she has an emergency dentist appointment.
Dwight: Emergency dentist appointment.
Creed: Now I'm told she told her manager she had the flu.  I'm a trusting guy, but uh, I just wish Debbie Brown had been there.  We would have caught this.
Pam: Yes, I'll be sure someone returns your call.  I'm so sorry.  Bye.
Barbara: Hello, I'm looking for Michael Scott.
Michael: Mrs. Allen is our most important client... because every client is our most important client.  Even though she's a pretty unimportant client, really.
Michael: And so, with the eyes of the nation upon us, I would like to say that Dunder Mifflin truly regrets this unfortunate incident.  And, as a gesture of gratitude, for your continued loyalty, Mrs. Allen, I would like to present you with this novelty check, for six months of free paper or 25 reams, whichever comes first.
Dwight: [snaps picture with his camera phone] You look good in this.
Michael: So, let us consider this matter ended.
Barbara: Well it isn't ended.  I'm... I'm very angry. I--- I could have lost business.
Michael: I know, I know you're angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
Barbara: I don't accept your apology.  The watermark was obscene and horrifying.
Michael: Well, we are extremely sorry.
Barbara: I don't accept.
School Official: I'll be with you in a moment.
Jim: All right.
Andy: Who was that guy she was talking to?  At her locker.
Jim: Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
Andy: But who
Jim: Probably
School Official: The issue with the watermark is very serious.
Jim: Absolutely.
School Official: We teach our students that character counts.
Jim: And you should.
School Official: But---
Andy: [scoffs] Pfft.  You don't teach it well enough.  One of your students is a
Jim: Andy... is having a
Andy: I want to take out an ad, in your yearbook.  A full page, two words---
Jim: Good luck.'
Andy: That's not what I had in mind.
Kelly: Ask where he's from.
Angela: [on phone] Where are you from?  Ohio?  That's nice.  So what do you want?  [to Kelly] He's upset about the watermark.
Kelly: OK, great.  Now tell him that it was an unfortunate error, and we're doing everything we can do to fix it, and that you're sorry.
Angela: [on phone] It was an unfortunate error.
Kelly: And you're sorry.
Angela: ...and the company has already apologized, so you can take that apology or not. [hangs up] [to Kelly] I think he had Tourette's or something!
Michael: We... are going to do everything humanly possible, to ensure that this never happens again.
Barbara: Well, it--- it doesn't help, because it already happened to me.
Michael: The watermark... it's a one time thing.
Barbara: I don't care!  It was disgusting.  Cartoon characters having sex?
Dwight: May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
Michael: OK...
Dwight: I grew up on a farm.  I have seen animals having sex in every position imaginable.  Goat on chicken.  Chicken on goat.  Couple of chickens doin' a goat, couple of pigs watching.  Whoever drew this got it exactly right.
Michael: What... can I do, for you?
Barbara: I, for starters, I think that you should resign.
Michael: Well... [exhales] OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
Barbara: You're the head---
Michael: The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
Barbara: You're the head of the company!
Michael: I'm
Barbara: Yes, and that makes it your responsibility---
Michael: No, I'm a regional manager---
Barbara: And so you should lose your job!
Michael: No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
Barbara: Fine.
Michael: That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
Barbara: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: It's non-transferable...
Michael: Doesn't matter.  Out please!
Barbara: I'm calling the Better Business Bureau.
Michael: Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline! [to Chad Lite] Did you get all that?
Chad Lite: Everything.
Michael: We gotta do something. [exhales] This is spinning out of control, Pam.  This is just, not...
Pam: It's just the Scranton Times...
Michael: No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
Pam: You know what?  I really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two.
Michael: You're right.  It will blow over.  But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  [pulls out a video camcorder from his desk] Do you know what this is for?
Pam: Yes.
Pam: Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos.  He says he needs a woman's touch.
Michael: [Dwight is spraying far too much hairspray into Michael's hair] OK, I think that's good.
Michael: Hello.  I am Michael Scott, Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton.  By now you are probably sick of hearing about Dunder Mifflin and our embarrassing watermark boner.  Let me tell you something.  Something from the heart.  I am not leaving this office.  It will take a SWAT team, to remove me from this office, and maybe not even that.'
Dwight: Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Michael: That's how devoted I am to this job.
Dwight: I'm just saying...
Michael: I know.
Dwight: They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
Michael: I understand that, Dwight.
Dwight: You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
Michael: Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
Dwight: Cut.
Michael: So I'll know where---
Pam: Cut.
Michael: I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
Pam: Cut.
Michael: OK, ready?
Angela: Kevin, what's four plus seven?
Kevin: [thinks] Eleven.
Angela: Yeah, well you didn't know that when you filled out this payroll form.
Kevin: Yeah, well at least I didn't suck at customer relations.  Oooh, yes.  Facial.
Oscar: [laughs] Yes. [air high five]
Angela: You two are apes.
Oscar: I expect you to apologize for that, Angela.
Angela: I'm sorry... that you're both morons.
Kevin: Oh, but you still said 'I'm sorry.'
Angela: I called you morons.
Kevin: Still said it.
Oscar: Still said it, so... [Kevin and Oscar screw up an air high five]
Michael: Five, four, three.  'There is no way, I will resign.  It wouldn't be fair.  Not to the good workers I work with, not to my clients, and especially not to me.  Let's not forget who this whole resigning business is about, anyway.  If I could leave you with one thought, remember... it wasn't me.  They're trying to make me an escape goat.  If I am fired, I swear to God, that every single piece of copier paper in this town is going to have the F-word on it.  The F-word.  You have one day.'
Pam: One day for what?
Michael: That's... they always give an ultimatum.
Pam: OK.
Michael: Good, cut?
Pam: Cut.  That was your best apology video ever.
Michael: Thought so too.
Creed: [to Dwight] Got a farewell card for Debbie Brown.  I thought maybe you'd like to sign it.  Maybe throw a couple of bucks in there for her.  She's got some children.
Creed: I feel terrible about Debbie Brown.  She got fired because of Dwight.  So I thought I'd pass around a goodbye card, maybe everyone could put in a couple of bucks to help her through these difficult times.  Why do bad things always happen to the good people?  It's tragic.  Just tragic.
Jim: You want music?
Andy: I don't care.
Jim: Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
Andy: Yeah.
Jim: [singing the intro to The Lion King's 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight'] A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy: You know what--- I don't---
Jim: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy: [Joins in with classic Andy falsetto] Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Jim: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy: Oooo-oo-oooo-ooo-oo-oooo-oo-ooo-ooo a-wi-imbube!
Jim: A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Andy: Sweet.
Dwight: [walks in dressed as Jim] Pam.
Pam: Hey, Dwight.  You look really nice today.
Dwight: [scoffs] Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
Karen: Hey, Dwight, lookin' sharp.
Dwight: Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
Jim: Do you?
Karen: No.
Jim: OK.
Karen: I'm good.  Thanks.
Jim: [Dwight imitates the 'Jim face'] Look at that.
Dwight: I'm Jim Halpert. [more horrible 'Jim faces']
Jim: Spot on.
Dwight: Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
Kelly: Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. And rest assured your voice has been heard. Okay, I'll be thinking about you all day.
Ryan: Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day. Customer service, this is Kelly. Oh my God, I am so sorry, that is so messed up. Everyone here is so upset, you have no idea. I'll be thinking about you all day.
Michael: The key to a crisis is dealing with it right away. Like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles. If you don't act fast, you will lose customers.
Dwight: Hello, CNN? I need to speak to your Scranton-area bureau chief? All right, then the bureau chief for the Greater Wilkes-Barre area? How about, ah, Lackawanna County. Okay, Northeastern Pennsylvania then. This is extremely urgent! No... you put
Kelly: Customer service isn't like accounting. It's not just typing numbers into a calculator and then it tells you an answer.
Oscar: We do a lot more than that.
Kelly: Okay, or hand out checks, or whatever it is you do. Look, I know the reason that you guys became accountants is because you think that people don't like you. But guess what, from now on you guys are not losers! So give yourselves a round of applause.
Oscar: I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.
Kelly: The annex rocks.  All you need to do is make sure that you make a connection with the customer. They just wanna know that you're sorry. Do that and you'll be fine. Make sense?
Angela: Mm-hm.
Kelly: Okay, role-playing time!
Angela: Alright, I think I'm trained.
Kevin: Ooh, can I be a pirate?
Creed: [hums]
Chad Lite: Hello.
Creed: Hey!
Chad Lite: Excuse me. You're Creed Bratton, guitar player for Grass Roots in the late 1960s.
Creed: I am indeed. How'd you know that?
Chad Lite: I wrote your obituary.
Creed: Oh, oh that's right! Good work. Thank you very much, sir [shakes hand].
Creed: About 10 years ago, for tax reasons, I faked my own death. I've been collecting benefits as my own widow ever since.
Andy: Oh, my God!
Jim: Oh, my God! Wow.
Andy: I had no idea.
Jim: Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
Andy: How could I not have realized?
Jim: She looks older.
Andy: Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
Jim: No.
Andy: She acts older, too. She knows everything about European history, and photosynthesis, and she made me this lanyard with, like, a Fimo clay thing. She's a real Renaissance woman.
Jim: Or a high school girl. Let's go [mouths 'wow' to the camera].
Andy: Chicken pot pie.
Jim: What's that?
Andy: That's what I was eating, in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven for dinner. And I got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt, and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation.
Jim: Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Andy: She lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to.
Jim: You shouldn't be talking about that.
Andy: I threw in some scratch tickets, 'cause generous guy, and next thing you know we're making out in the woods.
Jim: Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
Andy: No, we were really making out in the woods.
Jim: No, can't help you now.
Andy: I gotta go talk to her.
Jim: No. D-
Michael: With dissatisfied clients, it doesn't matter what you did. All they wanna hear is that you're sorry. They're like women that way. And this client is a woman. So when I say I'm sorry, it will be twice as effective.
Michael: So we're good?
Barbara Allen: No, we're not.
Michael: I'm sorry.
Barbara Allen: Well, okay. But I don't accept.
Dwight: [whispering] Say you're sorry times infinity...
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: ...'cause there's no comeback for that.
Michael: All right. We are infinitely sorry.
Barbara Allen: I'm still furious.
Michael: You understand? You... you get this check.
Barbara Allen: Mmm.
Spanish Teacher: Can I help you?
Andy: Yeah. I'm Mr. Bernard Johnson, MD. I'd like to talk with Jamie about a certain heart condition. Diagnosis: broken.
Jamie: Get out of here, Andy.
Andy: Who's this guy?
Jamie: My boyfriend.
Andy: You're such a liar.
Spanish Teacher: Sir? You need to get out of here, before I call the police, okay?
Andy: Yeah, maybe you should call the police. See whose side they take. Warning, most cops are dudes.
Jim: Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.
Spanish Teacher: What?
Dwight: I don't believe in apologies. When someone in the yakuza makes a mistake, they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger. And in that way, save face. And knowing the Japanese, they probably get an even better prosthetic finger. With a knife you can take out of it, or a screwdriver or a corkscrew.
Angela: Why am I getting all of the bad ones?
Kelly: Why can't you just say you're sorry and make them feel better?
Angela: I'm not gonna lie and say I'm sorry when the company didn't do anything wrong. That's immoral, and this is ridiculous.
Oscar: Would you, please? Please.
Kelly: Well, you have to do what I say, okay? Because Michael put me in charge, even though you're old enough to be my mother.
Angela: What? Well what you say is stupid, and your job is pointless. And you're a slut and everyone thinks so.
Kelly: Well, you're fired, okay? Go back to accounting, Angela.
Angela: Gladly. I quit.
Kevin: If cartoon characters didn't have sex, then how would we get new cartoon characters? From the sex! [giggles]
Michael: The customer is always right. Mrs. Allen was our customer. She was wrong. Is that a contradiction? No. Because she's not our customer anymore.
Pam: Michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos. My favorite is the one for his mother.
Michael: Hey, Mom. Happy birthday, belatedly. Sorry I forgot. I had put it on my calendar and Pam threw that out.
Pam: My personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association.
Michael: And without denying the seriousness of the situation, I would just like to remind you that in much of the Netherlands, swimming naked is the norm. So in Norway, you'd be the weirdos.
Jim: Okay, Andy, we need to go. Seriously.
Andy: Dude, there she is. Don't look, don't look. She's sitting with Denise. How am I supposed to do this? Denise hates me.
Jim: Don't do it.
Andy: What is your problem, man? Can't you support a bro? That's why you don't have any friends, Tuna. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just, I need...
Jim: That's okay.
Andy: ...your help. I love her.
Jim: What?
Andy: Yeah. I lo- I love her. Is this what love is?  This, like, horrible feeling in my stomach?
Jim: No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.
Andy: Look, okay, just be my wingman. Beer me five minutes. Talk to Denise. She's really into White Russians and whippets.
Andy: Jamie, can I talk to you for a second?
Jamie: Yeah. I only have a minute.
Jim: [sits down next to Denise] So, high school.
Denise: Do you have a cigarette?
Jim: Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
Denise: There's nothing to do in this town.
Jim: You should take up a musical instrument.
Denise: Yeah, I should take up that. Jamie?
Jim: Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
Denise: He's dead. Hey, do you have any weed?
Jim: No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
Denise: How old are you?
Jim: How old do you think I am?
Denise: Forty?
Jim: [shakes head]
Denise: Are you someone's dad here?
Jim: Not that I know of.
Denise: Ew. What kind of car do you have?
Jim: I drive a Saab station wagon.
Denise: My dad just gave me his old Lexus.
Jim: Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?
Andy: What?
Jim: Yup.
Dwight: Very well [hangs up phone]. I just got a call from Debbie Brown over at the mill. She claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself.
Creed: No time. Dwight, I love Debbie Brown. She's a close personal friend. But quality is my life. This company has a reputation to uphold. As much as it pains me, someone has to be held accountable.
Dwight: You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
Michael: Are we ready?
Dwight: Final touch-ups.
Michael: Okay. Am I shiny?
Dwight: Yeah.
Michael: Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.
Dwight: I don't know...
Michael: [clears throat] Stop it.
Dwight: [coughs]
Kelly: Hey, Angela. I'm sorry that I said you were old enough to be my mother. I don't know why I said that. I think I might be hypoglycemic or something, but still, it's no excuse. So, I'm very sorry.
Angela: Oh. Thank you, Kelly [long pause]. And I wish I hadn't called you stupid.
Kelly: Do you think I'm a slut?
Angela: No, but some of your outfits are not appr-
Kelly: Apology accepted! [hugs Angela]
Angela: I didn't apologize.
Kelly: We're like best friends now!
Angela: We're not.
Kelly: I'll text you!
Angela: Don't!
Kelly: Bye, Angela!
Angela: Fine.
Kelly: That is all I was looking for today. She got something out of my training session. I mean, she will never work in customer relations. Oh, my God, no. Never. But maybe she'll be less of a grump.
Angela: Kelly's not so bad. She really taught me something today [rolls eyes].
Michael: I have literally apologized an infinite number of times on this, and there are still calls for me to resign. Calls from an annoying woman, and possibly even the media alike. Well let me tell you something, something from the heart. I will not resign. I need this job. My mortgage is hundreds of dollars a month. With this job, I can barely cover that. I have a company car, but I still have to pay for gas, and gas prices are high. And I have no savings whatsoever. And it wasn't even me. It's so not fair that they want me to resign.
Dwight: ...to the fullest extent of the law [hangs up phone]. Listen up, everyone! I just got off the phone with the mill.  Final responsibility for Watermark-gate has been assigned. Floor manager Debbie Brown has officially been terminated. Lets give a big hand to Creed Bratton, without whose earnest and diligent sleuthing this scandal might never have been resolved [claps].
Creed: Just doing my job, guys.
Jim: [to Pam] Hey.
Jim: [Dwight hands Jim a piece of paper] Oh, what's this?
Dwight: That is a demerit.
Jim: [reads demerit] 'Jim Halpert, tardiness.' Ugh. I love it already.
Dwight: You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
Jim: Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
Dwight: [scoffs] Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
Jim: Lay it on me.
Dwight: Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Jim: Now that sounds serious.
Dwight: Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Jim: Which would be me.
Dwight: That is correct.
Jim: OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Dwight: What's a dis... what's that?
Jim: Oh, you don't want to know.
Pam: [door opens] Hey, Phyllis. You all right?
Phyllis: I think I just got flashed.
Pam: What? Really?
Phyllis: In the parking lot.
Pam: Oh, my God.
Dwight: [jumps out of his chair and runs for the door] Move!
Jim: OK, I'll call the
Andy: What happened? What can I do to help?
Jim: [on the phone] OK.
Andy: I'll check the web.
Jim: [on the phone] Thank you. [hangs up the phone] The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
Pam: [to Phyllis] Can you tell us what happened?
Phyllis: Um... I was walking to the building and this man asked me for directions. And he was holding a map. And when I walked over, he had it out... on the map.
Angela: Phyllis. You're a married woman.
Creed: The guy was just hanging brain. I mean, what's all the fuss?
Creed: If that's flashing, then lock me up.
Pam: [whispering] It's just, like, so creepy.
Ryan: [whispering] Yeah. [Pam and Ryan whispering]
Michael: What's happening?
Pam: Oh, some guy exposed himself to Phyllis in the parking lot.
Michael: Really? Is she OK?
Pam: Yeah, Bob Vance took her for a walk to calm down.
Michael: OK. [deep breath] Phyllis, you say? [snorts] Hmm. [suppressed laugher]
Angela: What is so funny?
Michael: Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
Kevin: I'm guessing not.
Michael: [laughing softly] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Jim: Mm... not really, no.
Pam: It's disgusting and demeaning.
Michael: Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone]
Toby: Hey, what's going on? There's a police car in the...
Michael: What? Oh. [makes descending scale noise as his finger goes down]
Toby: What's going on?
Michael: Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh... [laughs]
Toby: I don't think laughing about it is an appropriate response.
Michael: Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Toby: I don't think the women in this office -
Michael: Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
Toby: I was at a parent-teacher conference.
Michael: Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
Michael: In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.
Jan: [on speakerphone] Michael, ...
Michael: Huh?
Jan: ...come over after work tonight, OK? I miss your body.
Michael: I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Jan: I'll give you $200. And if I get up before you, I'll leave it on the dresser.
Michael: Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
Jan: $300?
Michael: I... uh, well, I don't know.
Jan: You know whatever. Just let my assistant know if you're coming over so he can get more vodka, OK? Hunter, are you on?
Hunter: [on speakerphone] You got it, Jan.
Dwight: Employees of this office are very small and delicate. Deserve  protection from local pervs. Better 1,000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free.
Michael: [exhales] I am sick over this thing. Those people out there are clearly afraid. And that can't happen. Not in my house.
Dwight: Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Michael: OK.
Dwight: [lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Michael: This is the last
Dwight: Look at that one.
Michael: Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid. [Dwight takes the Polaroid and crumples it in his hand]
Michael: Attention, everybody. Dwight has something he would like to say.
Dwight: Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Jim: [raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Dwight: Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?
Pam: Phallus?
Dwight: Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Pam: I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.
Phyllis: I didn't really get a good look.
Pam: That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.
Karen: Hey, did you guys see this memo that Dwight sent out? [reads memo] 'Women will be sent home if they wear makeup or heels exceeding 1/4 inch. Females are not allowed to speak to strangers unless given written authorization by Dwight Schrute.' This is ridiculous.
Dwight: Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
Karen: Dwight, this memo that you distributed is insulting.
Dwight: Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Pam: [reads memo] 'Sleeves down to the wrists, buttoned-up collars, and muted colors.' Nobody dress like that. [camera pans over to Angela]
Michael: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
Karen: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.
Michael: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
Dwight: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Michael: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
Jim: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
Michael: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
Dwight: [eating banana] Mm, less than three.
Michael: That is not current.
Dwight: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Jim: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Dwight: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
Michael: You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
Michael: I, um... would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter.
Creed: Are we still discussing this? I say again, what is the big deal?
Michael: Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
Meredith: I don't remember doing that.
Angela: What a surprise.
Michael: OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
Dwight: Alien
Michael: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
Andy: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.
Kevin: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.
Karen: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.
Michael: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
Karen: I'm saying that you're being sexist.
Michael: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Karen: That - it's the same thing.
Phyllis: Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Phyllis: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.
Michael: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
Angela: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.
Michael: I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Dwight: I wish I could menstruate.
Dwight: If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.
Karen: Can we just get back to work?
Michael: Ye - OK, yes.
Angela: This is not work talk.
Michael: You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]
Karen: Frankly, it's kind of insulting. But I have a bunch of stuff I need to return in my car. So... I could do that.
Angela: Malls are just awful and humiliating. They're just store after store of these horrible salespeople making a big fuss out of an adult shopping in a junior's section. There are petite adults who are sort of... smaller who need to wear... maybe a kids' size 10.
Michael: OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!
Dwight: Have you finished with the sketch?
Pam: Yeah.
Dwight: Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
Pam: Uh, Phyllis got a good look.
Dwight: Hmm.
Dwight: [Pam's sketch looks like Dwight with a mustache, but without his glasses] I plan on plastering this pervert's face everywhere. You can run, but you cannot hide.
Pam: [tires screeching] Oh.
Angela: Meredith, slow down! We're not gonna get there any faster if we're dead.
Meredith: Thanks. I know how to drive. [dumps the crumbs from a bag of chips she was eating into her mouth and throws it out the window]
Pam: Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.
Meredith: My car, my rules.
Kevin: Hey, Jim. You wanna go in the women's bathroom?
Jim: No. Thank you, though.
Kevin: You aren't curious?
Jim: Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
Kevin: Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.
Jim: I think you mean a girl's
Kevin: [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.
Jim: Go crazy.
Kevin: [in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God.
Andy: I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.
Dwight: Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
Andy: This guy looks like a real deviant.
Dwight: No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Andy: Aye, aye, Cap'n.
Dwight: More like, 'Aye, aye, General.'
Michael: [Meredith parking the car] I don't think she's gonna make it. Don't think she's gonna make it - [metal scraping]
Meredith: It's a little too tight. I'm gonna find another spot.
Michael: Many women
Dwight: [marks Scranton  with a red pushpin on a map of Pennsylvania and exhales] This is what we
Jim: [in women's bathroom] Well, I stand corrected. This is pretty cool.
Kevin: Yes.
Toby: Hey, uh... where'd you decide to take Karen tonight?
Jim: Anna Maria's.
Ryan: What's the occasion?
Jim: Six-month anniversary. What?
Ryan: Nothing - I think, uh, we all kinda thought you guys were just, like, hooking up.
Jim: No, we've been dating for six months.
Ryan: Uh, she might mention an email that I wrote a while back, um -
Jim: Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
Ryan: I figured. It's cool. I don't - I wouldn't want to be in an office relationship anyway.
Michael: All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.
Kelly: Thanks, Michael.
Angela: Thank you, Michael.
Michael: You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
Pam: What do you want to dish about?
Michael: Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.
Pam: OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?
Kelly: Awesome. Um, awful, I mean. But, uh, sometimes awesome.
Michael: What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Phyllis: Oh, it can be fun.
Michael: Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
Karen: It's a pretty common one.
Michael: I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Angela: OK. I'm gonna be at the doll store.
Angela: Sometimes, the clothes at GapKids are just too flashy. So I'm forced to go to the American Girl store and order clothes for large colonial dolls.
Pam: Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.
Michael: Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
Pam: Oh, my God.
Michael: [groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
Karen: That is not healthy behavior.
Michael: No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
Pam: Michael, you need to get out of this.
Michael: No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
Pam: No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]
Michael: No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]
Pam: Read the pros first.
Michael: OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Phyllis: She does have very nice clothes.
Karen: OK, OK. Um, cons.
Michael: Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
Pam: What was the last one?
Michael: She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Phyllis: No, the one before that.
Michael: I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
Pam: Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.
Michael: I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
Karen: Look, most relationships have their rough patches. You just have to push through it sometimes.
Michael: Yeah, that's smart.
Pam: Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.
Michael: That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
Phyllis: I bet you know. Don't think, just answer. What do you want to do about Jan?
Michael: I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
Phyllis: My mom taught me that.
Michael: Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.
Pam: No one said it has no calories.
Michael: Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.
Michael: Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.
Kevin: [in women's bathroom] This is so great, huh? We should do this much more often.
Toby: I-I think we hang out an appropriate amount of time.
Creed: What are you doing in here? This is the women's room.
Kevin: You're in here.
Creed: I pay for that privilege. [goes into stall]
Kevin: [all get up to leave] OK.
Creed: [wearing headphones and speaking loudly] I'm a pretty normal guy. I do one weird thing. I like to go in the women's room for number two. I've been caught several times and I have paid dearly.
Michael: Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.
Karen: Phyllis. What do you think? Too much?
Phyllis: Jim's gonna love it. [Karen giggles]
Pam: I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.
Angela: [in the car] Slower. Slower. Meredith. [Michael's cell phone ringing My Humps] Slow it up.
Michael: Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do?
Karen: Answer it.
Pam: Don't answer it.
Michael: OK, it stopped.
Kelly: [bang] Whoa.
Meredith: [tires screeching] Crap.
Jim: [snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.
Kelly: Michael, you know how to, um -change a wheel, right?
Michael: Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
Pam: Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.
Michael: Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]
Pam: I think I've got it.
Michael: Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Pam: I don't think we really need that, Michael.
Michael: Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
Pam: You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!
Andy: Think we'll find him?
Dwight: Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
Andy: [pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?
Dwight: No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar]
Andy: Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.
Dwight: Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar]
Andy: Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.
Dwight: You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]
Michael: OK, I am really going to do this.
Pam: Good luck, Michael.
Michael: You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]
Karen: OK, remember, be strong.
Michael: I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.
Pam: Don't leave a -
Michael: [leaving a message] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. [Jan walks in] OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
Jan: Michael... [clears throat] I was, um... I was really unhappy with our conversation earlier. And I... I just - I couldn't stop thinking about it. So I decided that I would drive down here and apologize to you in person. So... [takes Michael's hand] I'm sorry.
Michael: Thank you.
Jan: So... we're good?
Michael: Abso-fruit-ly.
Jan: [cell phone vibrates] Oh. Hold on, I'm sorry.
Michael: No... No...
Jan: One second. Oh! It's from you. Uh, you wanna grab some dinner?
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: OK. [voice on phone] 'It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I want...'
Michael: Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'
Jan: Oh. [door closes]
Michael: [sighs] Any man who says he totally understands women is a fool. Because they are un-understandable. There's a wishing fountain at the mall. And I threw a coin in for every woman in the world and made a wish. I wished for Jan to get over me. I wished for Phyllis, a plasma TV. I wished for Pam to gain courage. I wished for Angela, a heart, and for Kelly, a brain. 'Michael, how can you appreciate women so much but also dump one of them?' You mean, how can I be so illogical and flighty and unpredictable and emotional? Well, maybe I learned something from women after all.
Dwight: [phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.
Jim: Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
Dwight: Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
Jim: No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Dwight: Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Jim: Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.
Dwight: You have information about the sex predator?
Jim: I saw him two minutes ago.
Dwight: Where?
Jim: In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
Dwight: [hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!
Jan: So how are you liking the Wall Street Journal subscription?
Michael: Love it.
Jan: Are you reading it everyday, like we decided you would?
Michael: Uh, yes, I am.
Jan: Good, good, it's the best business reporting isn't it?
Michael: Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.
Jan: Wait, wait, what cartoons?
Michael: The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
Jan: [Sigh]
Michael: We should really start recycling.
Jan: Right uh, Michael.
Kelly: Hey, what's going on?
Stanley: Phyllis got flashed in the parking lot.
Kelly: [Screams]
Stanley: Okay, you need to stop that right now.
Bob: Phyllis, you okay? You sure?
Andy: Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?
Dwight: I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
Andy: Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.
Dwight: If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
Andy: Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.
Andy: I should make you my vichyssoise.
Dwight: I will never be your vichyssoise.
Michael: Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?
Jim: No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Michael: Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.
Kelly: [sings] We're going to the mall.  Bye Ryan, bye.
Dwight: Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.
Michael: I got shotgun.  Damn it.
Andy: Let me be clear.  There's only one thing that's important to me, and its not friendship.  Its dominance, and I think I know a thing or two about dominating.  Okay, I lived with a dominatrix for three years in Stamford.  Mistress Lila.  Taught me more than any college professor I ever had, while attending Cornell, which is where I went to school.
Michael: Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!
Pam: It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...
Michael: Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.
Jim: That's pretty cool.
Andy: You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.
Michael: Idiot.
Michael: I learned a lot about women today.  And any man who says he totally understands women is a fool.  Because they are un-understandable.  Jan and I broke up. Why?  Because she didn't like one message I left on her voicemail?  But that is her peariagative.  I thought I understood women, but maybe, can't believe I'm gonna say this, maybe, women don't understand themselves.
Michael: Ughh... Blech.
Dwight: OK, where does it hurt?
Michael: Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
Dwight: No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
Michael: Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.]
Dwight: [reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.'
Michael: Maybe.
Dwight: The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.'
Michael: Not it. I don't have eggs.
Pam: About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.
Dwight: Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?
Michael: That's possible.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Uh-huh?
Pam: David Wallace is on line one.
Michael: The CFO? Ohh...
Michael: OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
Michael: To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?
David: [on phone] Michael, I am calling---
Michael: And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?
David: Jan is out of town right now.
Michael: Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
David: Michael?
Michael: ...you just gots to get your freak on.
David: Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
David: Michael?
Michael: Hmmm.
David: I am calling to see if you can come down and interview for a job we have opening in corporate.
Michael: Really?
David: Week from today. Bring your first quarter stats and your recommendation for who would take over the Scranton Branch.
Michael: Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
David: That's not necessary.
Michael: May God guide you in your quest.
David: Yes.
Michael: OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.
Meredith: Oh I'm excited. Today is Beach Day! And Michael is taking the whole office to the beach. So I'm wearing my bathing suit underneath my shirt [lifts up shirt, definitely
Michael: Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?
Oscar: I don't wear a Speedo, Michael.
Michael: Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.
Toby: Anybody need sun block? Got SPF 30.
Michael: Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
Toby: It's Beach Day...
Michael: Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
Michael: I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.
Toby: Hey, want my sun screen?
Pam: Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.
Toby: Uh-huh.
Pam: Thanks Toby.
Michael: Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
Pam: I thought we were just having fun at the beach.
Michael: We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
Michael: What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.
Pam: You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?
Michael: I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
Pam: I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?
Michael: This way to the partay bus.
Kevin: I just want to lie on the beach and eat hot dogs. That's all I've ever wanted.
Kevin: [singing] [Angela mouthing the words next to him] And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression. Said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.' [rest of office joins in at varying times] You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, Know when to walk away and know when to run. You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Michael: Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.
Stanley: Oh, sweet mother of God.
Michael: If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Stanley: Excuse me?
Michael: Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
Dwight: Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
Michael: Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
Dwight: I hope there will be management parables.
Michael: Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?
Pam: Like what?
Michael: Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Pam: Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?
Michael: Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
Michael: Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!
Angela: Everyone put on sunscreen.
Michael: Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in. [everybody sits down on beach] OK, everybody up! Circle 'round. [motions for circle to form] Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
Oscar: What?
Michael: Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
Dwight: Yes!
Michael: Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Michael: Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.
Dwight: I choose Michael!
Michael: I'm not playing.
Dwight: OK, temp.
Michael: Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.
Michael: We are going to choose team names. Dwight?
Dwight: We will be called Gryffindor.
Jim: Really? Not Slytherin?
Dwight: Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
Jim: I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Dwight: He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Jim: [starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
Dwight: OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
Stanley: I don't care what you call my team.
Michael: Then I will name your team the Red team.
Stanley: No [crosses arms], the blue team.
Michael: I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.
Andy: We will be team U.S.A.
Michael: Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
Michael: Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.
Michael: It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.
Stanley: There's already a twist, you're carrying an egg on a spoon.
Michael: Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]
Oscar: Come on Phyllis, you can do it. [Phyllis' egg falls off spoon] Ahh...
Stanley: Thank you so much.  [Stanley sits down and pulls out his crossword puzzle]
Andy: Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]
Kelly: I don't want to hit the big rock!
Andy: Don't worry. You're not...
Kelly: I know I'm near the big rock. I just know it.
Andy: No where near the big rock.
Kelly: [takes off blindfold] I just don't want to get hit by it...
Andy: What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.
Andy: I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone]
Jim: [to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.
Karen: Hole?
Jim: Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
Dwight: [to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!
Ryan: Can you just stop this right now, or I'm not gonna do this anymore.
Dwight: What are you saying?
Ryan: You have to stop yelling at me or I'm not gonna do the egg race.
Dwight: OK, I apologize for yelling at you.
Ryan: That's what being a good captain is about. It's about listening to the members of your team.
Dwight: I am trying to bring team spirit.
Jim: [to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!
Karen: [lifts up blindfold] Oh my God! You ass! [chases Jim and throws egg at him] [both laugh]
Pam: There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]
Michael: [off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook]
Dwight: [at Ryan holding egg in spoon] Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Mush! Mush! Come on you bastard! [Ryan takes off blindfold and throws it to ground along with egg and spoon] What the? Damn it temp!
Andy: [begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]
Michael: Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.
Pam: Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?
Michael: Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
Pam: When's the contest?
Michael: Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?
Pam: How am I supposed to... get...
Michael: Thanks a bunch.
Michael: A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.
Michael: OK, who's hungry [Kevin starts to put hot dog in mouth] No, no, no. Do not touch the food. Please. Not yet. That is our next event. A hot dog eating contest. [sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.
Kelly: Can I have a turkey burger?
Michael: No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
Oscar: Turkey is a healthy meat.
Dwight: It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table]
Michael: Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
Phyllis: Is there any mustard?
Michael: No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Michael: Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
Meredith: [eating hot dog] What is it?
Michael: I can't say.
Jim: You can't say, or you can't pronounce it?
Michael: The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
Kelly: Can we just take those first two things?
Michael: The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
Dwight: You're leaving?
Michael: I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
Andy: [slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast]
Stanley: Do you expect me to believe that you're truly making your recommendations on this basis?
Michael: [points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.
Stanley: I would rather work for an upturned broom with a bucket for a head than work for somebody else in this office besides myself. Game on!
Michael: Four. Three. Two. One. Stop your eating! And the winner is Andy Bernard, with 14 hot dogs!
Kelly: Team U.S.A.!
Andy: One came up.
Michael: 13 hot dogs, everybody!
Dwight: Damn it!
Creed: [holding a fish with all the meat stripped off] Nobody told me we were going to have hot dogs!
Dwight: Sabotage.
Angela: What? What are you saying? Did you say sandwich?
Dwight: No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.
Angela: I knew you were saying sabotage.  I was giving you an example of it. I will misunderstand everything that Andy says until he goes insane.
Dwight: If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Michael: It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.
Stanley: Uh, we don't have any safety mittens
Michael: Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go.
Karen: Get 'em big boy!
Michael: Aaaaaand, go!
Karen: C'mon, Jim!
Stanley: [growly noises, Jim looks terrified]
Jim: What are you doing?
Michael: Nice, Stanley!
Stanley: [to Jim] Sorry about that. It's all about taking points away from Dwight.
Jim: Yeah. No. Good.
Jim: Oh, my God. I have never seen that look in a man's eyes... ever. I thought that I might die. On beach day.
Oscar: If either of these guys are put in charge of the office I will transfer to Albany. Gil can come if he wants. I'm kinda looking for a way out of that relationship anyway.  I think I might try girls for a while. Angela thinks I can cross over. We'll see.
Dwight: [Andy and Dwight sumo wrestle] Gaaaaa....
Michael: One. Two. Three.
Dwight: Yaaaaa! Yaaaaa!
Michael: Excellent!
Dwight: Gryffindor! Gryffindor!
Andy: I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.
Dwight: That's not why you lost.
Andy: Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.
Dwight: Yeah, right.
Andy: Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]
Dwight: [bouncing off of Andy] Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
Andy: [Trying to wet bandana, falls in water] Oh, God! Waaa! Guhh! Wuuuh! Help! Angela! Angela, hey! Oh, thank God! Please tell somebody!
Angela: What, Andy?  Andy, what should I tell them?
Andy: Go tell them I'm floating away, obviously!
Angela: I don't understand what you want from me.
Andy: Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!
Angela: Sorry! Bye, Andy!
Andy: Angela!
Michael: I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?
Pam: I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.
Michael: Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
Pam: I really doubt it, Michael.
Michael: Please just check.
Jim: [on cell phone] Great. Yeah, I'll see you next week. Thank you, and here is Karen Filipelli. Bye.
Karen: Hello?  Yeah, hi David. Yes, I would like to be considered for the corporate position in well.
Jim: In well?
Karen: As well.
Jim: How would that work in well?  I just want to know.
Karen: Yes. uh, huh.
Jim: Wait a minute.
Karen: That would be fine.
Jim: If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
Karen: [whispering] Cut it out!
Jim: I don't!
Michael: What does a great manager need most of all? Courage.
Stanley: How so? I mean... sure thing, that sounds smart... I can't do this anymore! I'm goin' to sit in the bus.
Michael: Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
Michael: Who among you has the guts to replace me? Let him walk across these coals.
Kevin: Are you going to try it?
Angela: I'm not going to talk through the fire after your disgusting feet have gone through.
Kevin: Angela, it is a million degrees.
Pam: I'm gonna do it. And I fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital. That's the right spirit when doing a coal walk, right?
Michael: No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
Pam: I'd like to try it.
Michael: Pointless.
Pam: But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.
Michael: Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
Jim: Nope.
Michael: Ji.. why not? C'mon.
Jim: Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.
Michael: You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
Jim: That's harsh.
Michael: Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
Andy: [lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?
Kevin: Why don't you go Michael?
Michael: Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
Jim: And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Michael: Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.
Pam: Do you want us to count to three?
Michael: Yes. Count to three, please.
Group: Three. Two. One.
Michael: Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
Group: One. Two. Three!  Go! Do it!  Go, Michael.
Michael: Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
Creed: On the go that's after three.
Michael: Okay.
Group: One, two, three, go!
Dwight: No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.
Michael: Don't, don't.
Dwight: [walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!
Group: Wow. Go, Dwight. Keep moving.
Dwight: [standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!
Michael: I'm not going to give it to you.
Dwight: [falling on his knees, then on all fours] Aaagh, aaagh!
Group: [yelling excitedly for Dwight to get off the coals]
Pam: Michael, do something!
Dwight: Aggggh, that stings!
Michael: Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'
Angela: Or Mrs. 'Outside Hire.'
Michael: Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
Kelly: Who's Bob Hope?
Michael: God! He's a comedian.
Kelly: Oh, like Amanda Bynes.
Michael: Who's Amanda Bynes?
Kelly: She's from 'What a Girl Wants.'
Michael: Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
Jim: Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.
Michael: You are being too modest.
Jim: Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.
Michael: Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
Dwight: The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'
Pam: [breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...
Dwight: [finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.
Michael: That is a very, very funny story.
Pam: [runs over after walking over fire coals] Hey! I want to say something. I've been trying to be more honest lately and I just need to say a few things. I did the coal walk! Just, I did it! Michael, you couldn't even do that.  Maybe I should be your boss? Wow, I feel really good right now.  Why didn't any of you come to my art show? I invited all of you.  That really sucked. It's like sometimes some of you act like I don't even exist.  [turns and looks directly at Jim] Jim, I called off my wedding because of you. And now we're not even friends.  And things are just like weird between us, and that sucks. And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you.  And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.
Michael: Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
Group: Flintstones, meet the Flintstones.  They're a modern stone-age family. Ba-ba-da-da-da.  From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history. Ba-da-da-da-da. [overlapping singing of the wrong verses] When you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, we'll have a gay old time!
Michael: WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
Andy: Nice!
Michael: So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.
Phyllis: Well, Bob was going to just drive me.
Michael: No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
Pam: Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.
Pam: Jim, David Wallace is calling for you.
Jim: Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
Michael: Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?
Pam: You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.
Michael: Acrimonious.
Michael: This way to the party bus. Good.
Meredith: [Sign says 'No Alcohol, No Loud Talking'] Um, What the hell?
Michael: It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
Meredith: Um, I forgot my...
Michael: Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
All: Yeah!
Michael: Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]
Dwight: Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?
Michael: Nothing.
Dwight: If I guess, will you tell me?
Michael: No.
Dwight: Please?
Michael: No!
Dwight: Is that a sumo suit?
Michael: No.
Dwight: I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Michael: No, we are not.
Dwight: Please tell me. I've been so good...
Michael: You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...
Dwight: Please.
Michael: ...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
Dwight: Please.
Meredith: Can we please pull over at the next rest stop?
Michael: No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
Meredith: Pull over! Pull over! [Meredith uses a bush while all the other passengers look the other way, except Creed]
Michael: Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.
Michael: Any questions?
Jim: Just one.
Michael: Yup.
Jim: The torches are lit.
Michael: Yes, for dramatic affect.
Jim: No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
Michael: Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
Jim: Are you not gonna put out the torches?
Michael: Set!
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Go!
Phyllis: I think Jim would be a good boss. Plus he's eye candy. It's OK, Bob... Vance knows he's on my list. Um, George Clooney, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jim, and that British guy that got in trouble with a prostitute.
Andy: It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.
Michael: [sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?
Pam: Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.
Michael: Because he wasn't following the rules.
Pam: I think they were just having fun.
Michael: But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
Pam: It tells me nothing.
Michael: Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
Pam: There's 800 of them!
Michael: Okay, all right.
Michael: It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...
Meredith: Hotdogs are really unhealthy.
Michael: Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
Phyllis: Is there any mustard?
Michael: No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
Everyone: That's what she said!
Michael: No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?
Dwight: I do!
Michael: Who's got the hungry?
Dwight: I do!
Michael: Come on, Ryan...
Dwight: Let's go.
Michael: Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
Jim: Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.
Andy: Keep eating tuna, Big Tuna. Loser!
Jim: He's gonna throw up.
Michael: [Dwight and Stanley are in sumo suits] Ready! Go!
Phyllis: The guy who sits behind me and the guy who sits across from me are fighting to see who becomes my boss. [laughs]
Dwight: [Dwight knocks Stanley down] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Eat sand, you fat, old man!
Kevin: Oh, I'm out of it. Let's face it, the hot dog-eating contest was my best shot.
Ryan: Michael, since Andy isn't here, maybe I could be the team captain.
Michael: You? You haven't made a sale.
Ryan: I know, but I'd like to give this a try.
Michael: Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.
Andy: [in sumo suit, waves down a car, which swerves around him, runs after it, waving his arms] Wait! [throws sumo hair-hat at the retreating car]
Michael: Andy Bernard is in first place with four hot dogs!  Dwight Schrute is a close second with three and a half!  Here comes Stanley!  Here comes Stanley, with three hot dogs!
Michael: This is an inflatable sumo suit. [blows] Now, in the olden days, when they wanted to find a guy who could be king, they would have him pull a sword out of a stone.  Well, times have changed. [blows] And it's not even about who is the best sumo wrestler.  It's about who is the best boss.  And I don't even care who wins. [blows] It's how they wrestle in a blow-up suit... [breathes in] that will tell me all I need to know [blows] or how sumo... [collapses]
Michael: [at Dunder-Mifflin Corporate in NY] David!
David: [confused] Oh, Michael?
Michael: Are we all set?
David: Isn't our interview tomorrow?
Michael: Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
David: You happened to be in mid-town Mahattan?
Michael: Thought I'd catch a show.
David: In the middle of a work day?
Michael: Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
David: Okay.
Michael: Um, how many people are you interviewing?
David: We're only interviewing the branch managers and some other upper level company people.
Michael: Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
David: I don't think so.
Michael: Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
David: I believe we put you in charge.
Michael: Ah, great. No further questions.
David: Okay, Michael.
Michael: Okay.
David: I'm really looking forward to our interview.
Michael: And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
Michael: I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.
Kevin: [Jim walk through the door sporting an obvious new haircut] Hey.
Jim: Hey, Kev.
Kevin: What's different about you? You look worse.
Jim: Thank you.
Meredith: You got a haircut. It's sexy, hot.
Jim: Ohhh...
Meredith: Turn around.
Jim: No.
Meredith: Yes.
Jim: No way.
Meredith: Do it!
Andy: Blup-dup-do. What's up, Big Haircut? You are no longer Big Tuna. From henceforth, you shall be known as Big Haircut.
Jim: [exhales loudly] Andy...
Andy: What is it, Big Haircut?
Jim: Nothing.
Andy: Sorry, I can't hear you Big Haircut.
Jim: Yup.
Andy: What?
Jim: Karen suggested that I get a haircut for the interview tomorrow so that I could look presentable and not, as she so lovingly puts it, homeless.
Pam: Hey. I think it looks great.
Jim: Thanks, Pam.
Pam: After I had my little outburst at the beach, Jim was really nice about it. He just basically said that he missed my friendship too and I would always mean a lot to him and I understand where he's coming from.  For the record, I am not embarassed at all. It needed to be said, and I said it, and it only took me three years to summons the courage, so [quietly, and mock bowing] thank you.
Michael: [knock on door] Yeah.
Dwight: You wanted to see me?
Michael: Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight: But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.
Michael: Okay. Uh...
Dwight: [cries harder] Thank you, Michael.
Michael: Uh, okay.
Dwight: [sobbing, holding letter to chest] Thank you so much.
Michael: Stop crying.
Dwight: [sobbing] Thank you.
Michael: Ohhhhh...
Pam: Hey.
Karen: Hey.
Pam: Um, about the beach...
Karen: It's okay, we all say things without thinking.
Pam: Oh, no it's not that, I've actually been thinking that for a long time, and I'm glad I said it. I just... I'm sorry if it made you feel weird.
Karen: [confused] Oh. Okay.
Karen: Pam is... kind of a bitch.
Karen: Hey, what if we leave tonight? Grab a bite, get a hotel room, enjoy the city a little bit.
Jim: Ahhh... just have so much paperwork to do. [exhales] Wow. Done. Okay, let's do it.
Jim: So I was wondering if Karen and I could get off a few hours early 'cause we want to spend the night in the city.
Michael: Why so you can do it?
Karen: [looks annoyed]
Jim: Whoops.
Michael: No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
Jim: Hmmm.
Karen: Heh.
Michael: Moon each other.
Jim: Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?
Michael: All right.
Jim: All right.
Michael: Your loss.
Karen: Wait, how would you moon us if you were driving?
Michael: Cruise control.
Karen: Oh.
Kevin: So Jim, who do you think is hotter? Pam or Karen?
Jim: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now.
Kevin: Pam is taller.
Jim: You sure?
Kevin: Yes. She has bigger breasts, too.
Jim: Wow.
Kevin: I think Karen has a prettier face.
Jim: Uh, hmm. [thinking] Uh, hmm. What else?
Kevin: Well I mean Pam's face is really pretty too. It's a very tough call.
Jim: Hm. Really tough call.
Kevin: Yeah.
Jim: You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got.
Kevin: Will do.
Jim: All right. [smiles]
Oscar: Hey, Pam I've been meaning to say something to you.  I really miss our friendship. [group laughs]
Pam: Wow, very funny.
Stanley: I've never heard you talk that much. I thought it was Kelly.
Kelly: Are you kidding? I would have never done that. It was pathetic-ville. No offense, Pam.
Pam: [smiles]
Meredith: You know what? Don't even worry about it. Everyone was so drunk, I bet no one even remembers what you said.
Creed: I remember. I blogged the whole thing.
Creed: www.creedthoughts.gov.www/creedthoughts. Check it out.
Ryan: Last year Creed asked me how to set up a blog. Wanting to protect the world from being exposed to Creed's brain I opened up a Word document on his computer and put an address at the top. I've read some of it. Even for the intranet it's... pretty shocking.
Michael: There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.
Kevin: Do you think it's gonna to be weird working with Jan in New York?
Michael: No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
Oscar: Maybe you should talk to her? Before...
Michael: No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Oscar: Michael...
Kevin: What?
Angela: Why?
Oscar: I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.
Michael: Yes, I...
Angela: Wha? Who gave you that advice?
Kevin: Yeah, Michael you should never sell your condo...
Michael: I have to buy another place.
Angela: But you said you were in debt. [crosstalk]
Oscar: You're not sure that you have the job.
Michael: I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.
Dwight: How would you like to spend the night with the Regional Manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton?
Angela: No Dwight, I don't care if that is how they consolidated power in ancient Rome.
Dwight: No, no, not Michael. [whispers] Me. I'm taking his job.
Angela: [smiles] Not now. [Dwight leaves] Goodbye, Kelly Kapoor.
Dwight: [squeezing hand grips] Jim, Jim, Jim.  Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
Jim: Oh hey, Dwight.
Dwight: I am gonna be your new boss. [laughs] It's my greatest dream come true.  Welcome to the Hotel Hell.  Check in time is now.  Check out time is never.
Jim: Does my room have cable?
Dwight: No. And the sheets are made of fire.
Jim: Can I change rooms?
Dwight: Sorry, we're all booked up. Hell convention in town.
Jim: Can I have a late checkout?
Dwight: I'll have to talk to the manager.
Jim: You're not the manager even in your own fantasy?
Dwight: I'm the owner.  The co-owner. With Satan!
Jim: Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil?
Dwight: Yeah, but I haven't told you my salary yet.
Jim: Go.
Dwight: Eighty thousand dollars a year.
Dwight: Once I'm officially Regional Manager my first order of business will be to demote Jim Halpert. So I will need a new number two.  My ideal choice? Jack Bauer. But he is unavailable. Fictional. And overqualified.
Andy: [signing interview sheet] I will see you at the inter-view.
Dwight: Yes you will.
Michael: Who is D. Abramson?
Pam: He's from that company in Pitts...
Jan: [walks through front door] Michael.
Michael: Why... are you here?
Jan: Uh, how are you?
Michael: I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
Jan: I'm great. Uh, can we, can we talk... privately... for a minute?
Michael: Why privately?
Jan: I just, [quietly] I uh... I don't uh... I, I don't, I don't like the way that we left things.
Michael: Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
Jan: Okay.
Michael: Okay.
Michael: Pam, Defcon ten. Houston, we have a problem.
Pam: What do you want me to do?
Michael: Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
Pam: What about Meredith?
Michael: No. She's an alternate.
Michael: So, how you been?
Jan: Been good.
Michael: Good.
Jan: Good.
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: Sorry to drop by unexpectedly. I uh, I tried calling, but I kept getting voice mail.
Michael: Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
Pam: So, um, Michael needs us in the conference room.
Karen: Cause of Jan again?
Karen: Hey, uh, before I leave tonight, would you mind making a half a dozen copies of Jim's and my sales reports for our interviews tomorrow?
Pam: Uh, sure.
Karen: Thanks.
Pam: I really hope you get the job.
Karen: Thanks. [looks suspicious]
Jan: After you ended... everything with us, I went on a vacation.
Michael: Hmm.
Jan: To kinda clear my mind.
Michael: Sound good. Sounds fun.
Jan: It was.  Yeah, it was good. [laughs] I think I'll just get right to the point, you know?  Um, I, I feel good about myself for the first time in a really long time.
Michael: Hmm..
Jan: I've made some big changes in my life and... I miss you. I want us to get back together.
Michael: Would you excuse me for a second?
Jan: Ohh... [Michael leaves and walks into conference room]
Michael: Defcon twenty.  She wants to get back together.
Phyllis: What are you gonna do?
Michael: I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
Karen: Do you want to get back together with her?
Michael: No, no. What do I do?
Pam: Just don't get back together with her.
Michael: What if she makes me?
Angela: How can she make you get back together with her?
Michael: She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
Pam: This was a terrible relationship. You were not happy when you were with her.
Michael: I wasn't.
Pam: You're so much happier now. Just go in there and be strong.
Michael: You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
Pam: Right.
Michael: Wow.
Karen: Do it.
Michael: I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
Michael: [walks back into office with Jan] Okay. [clears throat] Jan, we need to talk. [Jan turns revealing that she has had her breasts enlarged]
Michael: Jan is in a different place right now, and it is a sign of maturity to give people second chances. So I am going to hear her out.
Pam: Oh my God. [mouths to Jim]
Jim: Yeah, bigger actually.
Pam: [whispers] That's crazy!
Jim: Mm-hm.
Pam: [mouths] Wow!
Karen: [moves to block Jim from Pam's eyeline] Oh my God.  Can you believe that?
Jim: Unbelievable.
Karen: Wow!
Jim: She could put the cup right there.
Karen: I know!
Pam: No, it's fine.  I'm sure it must have been weird for Jim when Roy and I were joking around... that
Meredith: I would never do that.  Waste of money.  In my experience, guys are way more attracted to the back of you than the front.
Kevin: I love fake boobs.  Often times, you find them on strippers.
Creed: I find it offensive.  Au natural, baby.  That's how I like 'em.  Swing low, sweet chariots.
Jan: So... [exhales] there are a lot of things that I would like to do differently.
Michael: Yeah.
Jan: I feel like, when we first got together, that I had a problem with my priorities.
Michael: First got priorities.
Jan: And if we could talk about a way to approach a possible reconciliation...
Michael: Let's get back together. [Jan smiles and laughs]
Michael: No.  No, no, no, no.  I'll tell you this, it is
Dwight: Okay, everyone, listen up! [claps]  Time to begin the interview process! [looks at sign-up sheet, only contains Andy's name]  Andrew Bernard.
Andy: Saving the best for first!
Karen: All right, you guys.  See you later, wish us luck!
Dwight: No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Oscar: Good luck, you guys! [everyone wishes them luck]
Dwight: What did I say!?
Pam: [to Jim] Good luck.
Jim: Thanks.
Pam: I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.
Dwight: I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?
Andy: White, because it contains all other colors.
Dwight: Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
Andy: You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.
Dwight: What is the capital of Maine?
Andy: The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.
Dwight: Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
Andy: Should not be a problem. I minored in history in the Ivy League school which I attended.
Dwight: You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.
Andy: I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?
Andy: I am a great interviewee. Why? Because I have something no one else has: my brain. Which I use to my advantage, when advantageous.
Dwight: [Andy and Dwight arm-wrestle, Andy is about to win] Time! No, you failed.
Andy: Damn it!
Dwight: This interview is over. I'll let you know.
Karen: [Driving to New York] Hey, thank you so much for driving me down for my interview.
Jim: Totally, no problem.  What are you interviewing for, by the way, my assistant? Or...
Karen: Oh, you know I'm gonna have a congratulations Karen party um, tomorrow night at my friend's house.
Jim: Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish?
Karen: No, I'm sorry I should have been clearer. It's for me.
Jim: Oh...
Karen: Cause I'm going to get the job.
Michael: [holding Jan's breasts] Remarkable.
Jan: Thanks.
Michael: Wait, wait. Check one more time.
Jan: Oh, okay.
Michael: Very good [Jan nods]
Jan: Well, I um, I have to get back, but I will see you in New York tomorrow, right?
Michael: Yes, indeed.
Jan: Good luck with your interview. [whispers] Bye.
Michael: So, I guess we're getting back together.
Pam: What happened?
Michael: Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
Michael: Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.
Karen: So we have all night.  Where do you want to go first?
Jim: Oh, I dunno, how about the U.N.?
Karen: How often do you come here?
Jim: Um, everytime my sixth grade class has a field trip.
Karen: I think you'll really enjoy this, adult Jim.
Michael: Hey, everybody.  The next time you see me, I'll be working for corporate. Starting tomorrow, Dwight Schrute will be running the branch. So without further ado,  [clicks on small tape player] I would like to start saying my goodbyes [Song: Thank You, by Natalie Merchant plays in background] Okay. Goodnight, and good luck.
Dwight: [Dwight clicks off tape player] Who's ready to work?
Jim: [Karen punches buttons on an ATM] Yeah, we went to the Spotted Pig for dinner. It's in the Village. Uh, Karen knew it. And then we second acted Spamalot. That's when you sneak in at intermission with all the smokers. And then we went to a bar that used to be a church. Oh and at this one bar, I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.
Karen: That wasn't him. [Jim nods, mouths, yes, it was]
Karen: So what's going to happen to us when I get this job?
Jim: Oh do you mean when I get the job?
Karen: Well,
Jim: You mean Kevin?
Karen: Exactly.  But you get it, right? Can't stay there.
Jim: Yeah, I do. C'mon. [they hold hands and cross street]
Michael: [exhales] How are you guys doing?  Need anything?
Karen: Uh, no, we're good.  Thanks.
Michael: I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
Jim: [points at bearded man] Who's that?
Michael: That
Jim: Beardy?
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Jim: I'm gonna introduce myself.
Michael: No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
Michael: I am by far the most qualified person they're interviewing.  Jim and Karen are here, which is cute.  They're like, kid actors tagging along with daddy, on the big audition, hoping to be discovered.  Except daddy... is the best actor around.  Daddy is Meryl Streep.
Dwight: Michael is gone.
Andy: Hail to the chief!
Dwight: My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.
Andy: My first order of business: accept.
Dwight: As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug]
Andy: Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]
Michael: Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.
Hunter: Uh, administrative assistant.
Michael: Jan in yet?
Hunter: I think she's comin' in... later.
Michael: Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Hunter: Sure.
Michael: Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means.
Hunter: Okay.
Michael: Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?
Dwight: You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.
Pam: Thank you.
Dwight: I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Pam: Really?
Dwight: Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
Pam: You will be your own assistant.
Dwight: Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Pam: Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,
Dwight: Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: Do you accept?
Pam: Absolutely, I do.
Pam: I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'
Michael: [knocks on door] Hello, hello!
David: Michael, good to see you!
Michael: Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
David: Oh, great.  I've been meaning to thank you by the way.  You didn't lose a single customer during the merger, and you still managed to trim the budget?  That is nice work. [Michael smiles] So, let me ask you a question right off the bat.  What do you think are your greatest strengths as a manager?
Michael: Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
David: Okay.  And your strengths?
Michael: Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
David: Oh.  Yes.  Very good.
Michael: Thank you.
David: Very good.
Phyllis: Dwight is our new boss.
Oscar: Oh, Michael's not going anywhere.
Pam: Then who do you think will get the job?
Kevin: Karen.  She looks corporate.  Those little pants suits.
Phyllis: I think it's gonna be Michael.
Oscar: Do you really think he's qualified for that job?
Phyllis: No, but he wasn't qualified for the job he has now, and he got that one.
Oscar: [laughs] Mm.  Yeah.
Dwight: Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.
Pam: [raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?
Dwight: Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
Oscar: So ten
Dwight: Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Stanley: Amen.
Dwight: Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
Kevin: [raises hand] Do we have to?
Dwight: Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Pam: I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.
David: What do you think we could be doing better?
Michael: I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.
David: Okay!
Michael: Okay.
David: Thanks for comin' in, Michael.
Michael: Thank you.
David: It is always a treat when our paths cross.
Michael: It is always a treat when
David: You're back together.
Michael: Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
David: Okay, uh.  Well, I thought it was clear in the description, the position... the job you're applying for... is Jan's job.
Michael: I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
David: No, we're letting Jan go.
Dwight: Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground
Kevin: [at the same time as Dwight] Trees.
Dwight: Trees!  And where do trees grow?
Kevin: [at the same time as Dwight] Forest.
Dwight: Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Stanley: Liquid.
Dwight: Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Stanley: I don't want it.
Dwight: Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Stanley: Make it 100.
Dwight: We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
Stanley: No.  In fact, I'll give you a billion Stanley Nickels if you never talk to me again.
Dwight: What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
Stanley: The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns.
Dwight: Okay---
Andy: That's it!
Dwight: What---
Andy: Class is canceled, everybody out!
Dwight: No wait, what are you doing?!
Andy: I'm punishing them.
Dwight: No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
Everyone: [grumbling, getting loud]
Pam: HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam]
Oscar: What--- What are you winking for?
Dwight: Zip your lid!
Karen: So, that's... my basic 5 year plan.  And after that, who knows?
David: Okay.  Uh, now, this may seem like an odd question, but...
Karen: Yeah?
David: ...what do you think about Michael Scott?
Karen: He's a very nice man.  And he's very well suited for the job he has now.
David: This is off the record.
Karen: He would be disaster.
Jan: Hey you!
Michael: Hey.
Jan: How was your interview?
Michael: Pretty good.
Jan: Yeah?
Michael: Could have gone better I guess.
Jan: Oh. [they kiss] I'll put in a good word for you.
Michael: Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Jan: What?
Michael: Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.
Jan: What's... what's the matter?  What... what happened in there?
Michael: I can't tell you.
Jan: Tell me what?
Jan: You son of a bitch!
David: Jan, this isn't the time, we're in an interview---
Jan: You're
David: Frankly, it's overdue.  Your behavior in the last two years has been completely erratic.
Jan: Erratic?
David: Recently, you don't even show an interest in your work!  You smoke constantly in your office.  You spend most of the day online shopping.  You disappear for hours at a time, sometimes days.  Always saying you're visiting your sister in Scottsdale.  You go to Scranton far more often than you used to---
Jan: [opens up her overcoat] Is it because of these?
Michael: Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Jan: No, I wanna know.  I wanna know!  Because if it is, then, then, then I will see you in court!
David: It's not.
Jan: No?
David: It's not.
Jan: Cause he likes them. [points to Michael] Okay? He likes them. And, and that is, that is all I care about.
David: The time has come for you to end your professional relationship with this company.  You are clearly unstable.
Michael: Hey!
Jan: Yeah!
Michael: No--- We're all unstable.
Jan: Okay, you know what?  I'm just not leaving.  I'm not leaving.  Not leaving.
Michael: David, I did not tell her.
Andy: It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.
Dwight: It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]
Andy: This is gonna look so awesome!
Dwight: It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
Andy: [laughs] Totally!
Jan: [giving a hug] Bye Hunter.
Hunter: Bye.
Jan: Good luck with your band.
Hunter: Oh, thank---
Jan: Don't let them change you, okay? [Jan drops several items, Michael and Hunter help pick them up, she starts to walk out the door] So long, [censored].
Michael: So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
David: Actually, Michael, I think we're gonna take it in another direction.
Michael: Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
David: No, we're not giving you the job.
Michael: You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
David: I do.
Michael: Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
David: Yes.
Michael: Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.
Karen: Wow.  That was some serious... hardcore... self destruction.
Jim: Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
Karen: Don't!  She's nuts! [they laugh]
Jim: Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Karen: Okay, good!  Because, um, a bunch of my friends are meeting downtown for lunch.  And, I was gonna meet them, so...
Jim: Okay.
Karen: Just call me when you're done.
Jim: Sure.
Karen: Good luck, Halpert.
Jim: Thank you.
Receptionist: [phone rings, picks up] Dunder Mifflin, this is Grace.  Sure.
Jan: Oh, God!  I mean, I just don't understand!  It's just
Michael: I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
Jan: Oh, just... No, actually I think it's good, you know?  It's fine, actually, I do.  I really think it's great that it happened.  Because, you know, my work has always been the thing that has gotten in the way of my happiness, so... [laughs]
Michael: Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
Jan: [sobbing] Oh, I know, I know.  It's just... I'm sorry.  It's just these painkillers that I started taking since the surgery.  Ohhh!  They make my moods totally unpredictable!  Wow!  What am I gonna do?
Michael: [whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
Jan: Live together.  Actually, wait a minute!  This could be great!  This could be perfect!  You know, my full-time job could be our relationship.  I could wear stretch pants and wait for you to come home at 5:15. [laughs] It could work.  This could work, really!
Michael: [in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!
Pam: How'd it go?
Michael: No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
Michael: Everybody, may I have your attention please?  It is with great honor and privilege that I announce to you that I have officially withdrawn my name for consideration from the corporate job.  I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?
Dwight: To intimidate my subordinates.
Michael: That's stupid.
Dwight: It was Andy's idea.
Michael: You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.
Ryan: I don't do that stuff anymore.
Michael: No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.
Michael: So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.
Pam: Did... Karen get the job?
Michael: [to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.
Dwight: Pam, hello.
Pam: Dwight, hello.
Dwight: I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]
Pam: No, I don't know what the future holds, but... I'm optimistic.  And, uh, I had fun goofing around with Dwight today.  Jim and I... are just... too similar.  Maybe one day I'll find my own Karen. But--- you--- that is, a, um, you know, not--- A man.  A man version.  But, uh, until then... I can hold my head up. ... I'm not gay.
David: I don't know how I feel about hiring a Sixers fan.
Jim: I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh]
David: Uh, let me ask you a question, Jim.  You're clearly a very bright guy.
Jim: Thanks.
David: Always hit your numbers, personable, you make a great impression on everyone you meet---
Jim: I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]
David: Uh, oh, hey, do you have your quarterly numbers?
Jim: Yes, absolutely.
David: And that, uh, questionnaire.  Sorry to make you fill that thing out...
Jim: Oh, no, absolutely.
David: ...that's a HR formality.  We have this very irritating HR guy here, he's probably the only person you're not gonna like.  [Jim notices a small note inside his papers, it reads 'Jim, Don't forget us when you're famous!  Pam'  It has a gold medal yogurt lid attached.] Kendall.  Ugh.  So, first up...
Jim: [hands David his papers] There you go.
David: How do you think you function here in New York?
Jim: [not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.
David: You've been in the Scranton branch a long time. [Jim stares at Pam's note] What have you liked most about that place?
Jim: [thinks] The friendships.
David: Okay.  Well, we want the person who takes this position to be here for the long haul.  So... long haul.  Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Jim: [flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?
Pam: Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh]
Jim: The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
Pam: I know.
Jim: And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
Pam: Well, I wish you would.
Pam: [phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.
Pam: I haven't heard anything, but I bet Jim got the job.  I mean, why wouldn't he?  He's totally qualified, and smart, everyone loves him... and, if he never comes back again... that's OK.  We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.  I'm totally fine.  Everything is gonna be totally--- [Jim walks in]
Jim: Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
Pam: Yes.
Jim: All right.  Then... it's a date.
Pam: [to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?
David: [on phone] So, I know we left the other day on a note of uncertainty.  But, after some more thought, I'm very pleased to be able to offer you this job.  [laughs] Great!  I'm so glad.  We're all very excited you're going to be joining us.  It'll be nice to have another MBA around here.
Ryan: [on phone, smiling] I'm excited too.  Okay.  Bye.
Kelly: Who was that?
Ryan: [still smiling] Nobody.  You and I are done.
Kelly: What?! [Ryan smiles and glances at the camera]
David: Where do you see yourself in ten years?
Michael: Well, [clears throat] I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
David: A... multivitamin?
Michael: Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
Phyllis: Michael, what happened?
Michael: Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Oscar: Home is where the
Michael: Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!
Kelly: Well, if Michael gets the job, I will be so upset, because Dwight used to have a crush on me, so if he's boss, it'll be really awkward.
Pam: Mmm-hmm. [nods]
Kelly: But if Jim gets it, you should be happy, because you have a crush on him, and he totally doesn't feel the same way, and then he'll be gone.
Pam: Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.
Kelly: Pam, he's just not that into you.
Pam: Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.
Kelly: No, seriously Pam, wake up.
Pam: Okay.
Pam: Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.
Dwight: Define scorched earth policy.
Andy: When an attacker goes through another country sometimes they wi...
Dwight: Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
Andy: It is the source of all energy on this planet.
Dwight: Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
Andy: I'm a very good interviewee.  Why?  Because I have something that nobody else has.  And that is... my brain.  Which makes me charming, witty, intelligent... [long pause] and quick on my feet.
Dwight: Who was the second man on the moon?
Andy: Trick question.  There was no second man on the moon.
Dwight: Inventor of the cotton gin.
Andy: Eli Edison.
Dwight: Talk me through an appendectomy.
Andy: Step 1, disinfection.  Step 2, incision.  Step 3, remove the appendix tenderly so it doesn't burst and spread toxic...icity everywhere.
Dwight: Step 5, [talking over Andy, indistinct] ...the wound.
Andy: Re-suture.  Sutures, yes.
Dwight: When is the Paleolithic Age?
Andy: 17 B.C.
Dwight: What is a scented candle?
Dwight: How is the new boss?  Tough.  Do people respect him?  They have to.  Do they like him?  Irrelevant.  They do not.  And I hate them back.
Michael: New York real estate.  I started by looking for a brownstone, like the Huxtables had, [shakes head] but instead I found this very, very, nice place in Jamaica, Queens, mon.  It is on the last stop of the subway, which is wonderful, because if I fall asleep, I still end up at home.  It is a suh-weeeet one bedroom.  I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win.
Jim: [phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?
Kevin: Oh, right. Thanks. [reading off index card] Dunder Mifflin, this is Kevin. Please hold while I transfer you. [cupping the mouthpiece, yelling] Oscar, your mom!
Jim: Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.
Kevin: Please hold. [cupping mouthpiece and holding out the phone] Andy! Phone call.
Jim: No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.
Kevin: Yeah, I wrote it on my hand... but then I washed it.
Jim: It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
Kevin: Okay. Andy, get ready. [muttering] Transfer. Extension. Transfer.
Jim: Here we go. [Meredith's phone rings. Jim and Andy groan.]
Kevin: Oh, man!
Andy: It is 1-3-4, Kev! [Kevin runs to the phone]
Jim: Kev, c'mon.
Dwight: Hustle!
Kevin: Hold it.
Andy: You are murdering the Nard-dog!
Kevin: [on phone] This is Kevin. Please hold and I will transfer you. [Phyllis's phone rings]
Angela: You're bad at this too!
Kevin: [running to the phone] Just... don't answer that call!
Stanley: Just transfer the damn call.
Kevin: Your call is very important to us. Ple-[Andy's phone rings]
Andy: Hey-o! [applauding and cheering]
Dwight: Way to go.
Andy: My maid died.
Pam: Today is my first day at my new job at Michael Scott Paper Company Incorporated. You know, Apple Computers started in a garage. And we're starting in a condo. So we already have a leg up on Apple. [picks up piece of mail] Look, it's official! [door opens, Michael is in a bath robe]
Michael: Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.
Pam: Michael, you were expecting me, right?
Michael: Yes I was. Yes I was.
Pam: Are you wearing anything under the robe?
Michael: That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
Pam: This looks great, Michael.
Michael: Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
Pam: Yes, please.
Michael: What shape?
Pam: ... Square is fine.
Michael: Alright.
Charles: Just want to fill you in on a few details. As you know, I will be running the branch while we search for Michael's replacement. So please feel free to come to me with any questions or concerns. [Kelly raises hand] Yeah.
Kelly: Where will you be staying while you're in Scranton?
Charles: Eh, uh, in a hotel.
Angela: Charles, where were you born?
Charles: Actually, I meant questions more about the day-to-day operations of the company. Kay. [Andy raises hand] Yeah.
Andy: How are operations of the company? Just, day-to day.
Charles: Okay, let's go over non-discretionary cuts. Okay, guys? [Charles sees Stanley with his crossword, Charles stares and he puts it away] Thank you. So, umm...
Jim: [whispering] Would you please stop that?
Dwight: What?
Jim: You're breathing very heavily.
Dwight: This is how I breathe.
Jim: No it's not.
Dwight: If you want to tell me -
Charles: Okay, Jim Halpert. I need your eyes up front.
Jim: Oh no. I was just -
Charles: No. Hey, hey. I just want to hear 'yes'.
Jim: ... Yes.
Charles: Good. As I was saying...
Dwight: Oh no! The new boss does not find Jim adorable! Ohhhh! [smiles]
Pam: So, what do you say we get started?
Michael: After breakfast.
Pam: I'm full.
Michael: So how you feeling about the new company?
Pam: I feel good. [sees a huge pile of French toast] Wow.
Michael: You excited? About the new company?
Pam: Yeah. I'm excited to start the company.
Michael: After breakfast.
Pam: We did that. So, what's next? Michael, just stop for a second. [reaches out to take the whisk] Michael. Stop for a second.
Michael: No, I'm whipping them.
Pam: No, I know you are.
Michael: Just let go.
Pam: Just let me have... Oh.
Michael: Let go, please. Just gimmee -
Pam: Fine! [eggs splatter all over his robe] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Michael: I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
Phyllis: I never see him drink. I never see him eat.
Stanley: I don't think he even uses the bathroom.
Creed: Oh, he does. He does.
Michael: [doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.
Pam: You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -
Michael: I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
Pam: I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.
Micheal: Whatever calms you down.
Pam: Okay, first, work out. And, hey! Look! You did that. Check. [Michael doing leg lifts] Eat an enormous breakfast. Check.
Michael: Don't patronize me, Pam.
Pam: I think you should get dressed.
Michael: I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
Pam: Michael, that seems impossible.
Michael: It's totally impossible!
Pam: We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.
Michael: Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
Pam: Great.
Michael: Okay, Ryan.
Pam: No. What? Why?
Michael: He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Pam: No. We're not gonna hire Ryan.
Michael: Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: He worked at that telemarketing place.
Pam: We'll find him.
Michael: Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
Pam: Really?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: We have an investor already?
Michael: Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
Pam: Michael, that's fantastic.
Michael: Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...
Pam: Hey! We need to get you dressed!
Pam: I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!
Michael: Alright.
Andy: [laughing at something on his computer]
Charles: You a soccer fan?
Andy: Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.
Charles: Well, that makes two of us.
Andy: No way!
Charles: Yeah.
Andy: I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.
Charles: I was actually in Germany for the 2006 World Cup Finals.
Andy: Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!
Charles: Yeah, I love the sport. I love the sport. Alright, man.
Andy: Cool!
Jim: I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.
Pam: Next on the list - open the mail.
Michael: Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'
Pam: No, okay. It's fine. It's fine. We're just gonna add 'find office'...
Michael: How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Pam: Next on the list --  song parodies.
Michael: Okay. Okay. 'Achey Breaky Fart.'
Pam: Great. Let's sing it in the car.
Michael: No! No No. No. 'My Stumps.' Like 'My Humps' but a guy with no legs.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: We can do this.
Pam: We can do this.
Andy: Whoa! And he just goes, 'Boom'. [kicking motion] Goal!
Charles: Yep. Yep. That's Pele.
Andy: You know your soccer, man.
Charles: I know. Yes I do.
Stanley: I prefer [looks down at palms] Maradona. Uhhh... Diego Maradona.
Charles: Oh yeah?
Stanley: From Argentina.
Charles: I didn't know we had so many, uh, soccer fans in the office.
Andy: I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...
Charles: What about you, Jim? You a fan of the game?
Jim: Uh, no. Nope. Not really.
Charles: Well, it's not for everybody I suppose. [Andy laughs]
Jim: It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
Charles: Yeah?
Jim: You bet.
Dwight: Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.
Jim: Well I do.
Dwight: Wow.
Jim: I play.
Dwight: You can be so modest sometimes.
Jim: Well, maybe you should get back to work.
Dwight: Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
Jim: Maybe we will someday.
Dwight: Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Charles: That's a great idea, Dwight.
Dwight: Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: I don't try and be anything that I'm not.
Charles: What do you say, Jim? Huh? Wanna play some soccer?
Dwight: Jim, what do you say?
Angela: Sounds fun.
Andy: I'm in it to win.
Dwight: Game on!
Charles: Okay. See you on the field, there, bro.
Jim: Let's... eh... see ya.
Charles: See you on the field. Ha, ha. I can't wait!
Jim: Yep, I used to play soccer in school. From second to fourth grade. I was on the orange team.
Pam: [Michael comes out with Vikram, arms raised] We got Vikram!
Vikram: You got me.
Vikram: Where are we going?
Pam: We have a meeting with an investor today.
Michael: Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back. [gets out of the car] Ah, okay.
Vikram: He seems really confident.
Pam: He can be.
Vikram: Confidence. It's the food of the wise man but the liquor of the fool.
Pam: Hm. I'm looking forward to getting to know you better, Vikram.
Michael: Hey. I would like a pair of size nine, please. [Ryan is working at the bowling alley] It's Michael.
Ryan: I'm swamped, Michael. [over the PA] Happy birthday to Sally in lane 27.
Michael: Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
Vikram: He's taking a long time. Is it possible he's bowling? I mean, you know him better than I do.
Pam: Yes. Yes, it's possible.
Michael: Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.
Pam: Michael! What's going on?
Michael: I'm...
Pam: Hey, Ryan.
Ryan: Hey, you.
Michael: Excuse me. Yes?
Pam: This wasn't on the list.
Michael: Yes, it is.
Pam: No.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: It's not.
Michael: It is.
Pam: [looks at list] When did you add this to the list?
Michael: Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Ryan: Sixty thousand dollars a year.
Pam: You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?
Ryan: What do you make, secretary?
Supervisor: Back to work, shoe bitch!
Ryan: I told you guys, I'm really busy here, so...
Michael: Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Ryan: What size shoes are you guys?
Michael: Uh, nine.
Ryan: What are those, a men's ten?
Pam: No.
Michael: [Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.
Pam: What is he doing?
Michael: He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
Pam: Oh my God.
Michael: He's already paying for himself.
Pam: Sorry!
Ryan: Where is it?
Michael: Right here.
Vikram: Hey, c'mon, guys. These are prime selling hours, you know.
Charles: Miner - [kicking a piece of trash]
Jim: Oh, there he goes.
Charles: ...sees his partner -
Jim: Yikes.
Charles: Halpert. He looks up!
Jim: Aw, man.
Charles: Defending duo! He sets him up! [Jim moves the piece of trash with his hands] He sets him up. Yeah. Oh-ho!
Jim: Oh! Goal!
Charles: Aw, man, I can't wait to play with you.
Jim: Aw, it's gonna be the [softly] worst.
Ryan: Do you guys want to hear about Thailand?
Michael: Oh yeah.
Pam: Sure.
Ryan: It was indescribable.
Michael: Sounds awesome.
Pam: Beat.
Vikram: What sort of investing club is this?
Michal: Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!
Pam: [mouthing to camera] Nana?
Nana: Michael!
Michael: People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.
Michael: Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.
Nana: So let's hear it.
Michael: Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
Nana: How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
Michael: By wanting it more. By working hard-
Nana: What's your mission statement?
Michael: Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
Charles: C'mon, Oscar. What positions do people play?
Dwight: Wing.
Kevin: Wag.
Charles: Jim. What do you play?
Jim: Left.
Charles: Forward or half?
Jim: Forward, definitely.
Chares: Okay, striker, huh?
Jim: Striker!
Charles: Let's see what you got in those legs!
Jim: Alright! Let's do it.
Charles: Alright. [Dwight blows whistle in Jim's face] No, no, no. That's supposed to be the kickoff.
Jim: Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping]
Michael: And I offer same day, free delivery.
Nana: Michael, I don't know about this.
Michael: Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
Nana: I'm not so sure.
Michael: Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Nana: See, this is what concerns me.
Old Woman: We could just give him a chance. It's not much money.
Michael: Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
Nana: This isn't a handout club. It's an investment club!
Michael: Okay.
Nana: I love you, Michael. I do.
Michael: Okay.
Nana: But no. I mean it. No.
Vikram: I thought Nana raised some good questions. What kind of a name is Nana?
Pam: It means grandmother.
Vikram: Oh, sweet Jesus. Look, I'm sorry to do this, but can you drop me back at the telemarketing building?
Vikram: You know, Michael? You want to succeed? You got to apply the same- [Michael slams door]
Andy: Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]
Charles: Oh, my God! Oh wow. Jim, what the?
Oscar: Phyllis, Phyllis.
Charles: Phyllis, are you okay? Are, you okay?
Phyllis: [muffled] No, I swallowed a crown.
Charles: Why'd you duck, Jim?
Jim: What?
Dwight: Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
Jim: Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
Charles: Does that make you feel better? Huh?
Jim: I'm sorry, Phyllis.
Charles: Oh, yeah. Jim's sorry.
Ryan: Do you get TNT? The station? Do you get TNT?
Michael: Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
Pam: I can't do this.
Michael: What's that?
Pam: I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.
Michael: Blech.
Pam: I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?
Michael: Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
Pam: We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.
Michael: Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...
Pam: How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!
Michael: I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]
Michael: You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.
Michael: I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.
Michael: [walks into room] Okay.
Pam: I could work here. I could see this.
Michael: It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
Pam: Are you good?
Michael: Yeah, I'm good. You good?
Pam: I'm good.
Michael: You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']
Charles: Michael, you're back.
Michael: Yes, I am, Charles.
Charles: Mmmhmm.
Michael: Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
Michael: It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]
Jim: LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair]
Pam: Morning Michael!
Michael: Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car]
Michael: I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!
Kelly: So. I thought we could take the customer on a... Then. Then we could...
Jim: You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Kelly: And...
Charles: Hey Kelly?
Kelly: Yes? Charles, you wanted me?
Charles: Oh, I meant, I meant that Kelly. [New receptionist walks in]
Jim: The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.
Charles: Oh, and Kelly...
Kelly: Yes Charles? Yes, you wanted me?
Charles: Okay, I'm gonna call you Kapoor, okay? And you, Hannon.
Erin: If we're changing names, can I be Erin? It's my middle name.
Charles: Erin. Okay, that's very pretty.
Kelly: Well you know what my middle name is? Rajani Ghana! And I hate it! I hate it!
Kevin: I thought Rajini Ghanda was a boy's name?
Michael: We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.
Pam: What should we do now?
Michael: We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
Michael: I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.
Michael: I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]
Pam: I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.
Andy: What do you think?
Dwight: Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Andy: Thank you!
Dwight: Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.
Ryan: You should come into town this weekend man. Yeah, we'll hang out Scranton style.
Michael: Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
Ryan: Please don't listen to my phone calls.  Yeah, she's like um, she'd probably be a Six in New York, but she's like a Seven here in Scranton. And then uh, my boss is my old boss from Dunder Mifflin. It's a small space.
Charles: Hey Jim can I get a, um-
Jim: Hi! [Awkward]
Charles: Hi. I need a rundown of your clients, can you get that to me.
Jim: Sure!
Charles: Yeah.
Jim: Okay.
Jim: What the hell's a rundown?
Jim: When did you need that rundown by?
Charles: As soon as possible.
Jim: Okay.
Charles: Just get it right.
Jim: Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
Erin: Oh.
Dwight: You know there's a ghost in this office
Erin: Really?
Dwight: A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
Erin: Why was she in this building?
Dwight: Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
Erin: That's crazy.
Dwight: Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Erin: Oh my god!
Dwight: It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Erin: Hmm.
Dwight: That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]
Erin: Oh! [Dwight and Erin laugh.]
Dwight: Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
Erin: Yeah.
Dwight: Yeah?
Erin: Just got some ice.
Dwight: Erin [eerie voice] Erin...
Andy: Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]
Erin: Oops!
Andy: Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage]
Erin: So I'll see you guys around!
Dwight: Hey buddy.
Michael: Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?
Ryan: Pam's better at that stuff
Pam: That is so insulting.
Ryan: How is it insulting to say that you're good at something?
Pam: Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.
Ryan: I'm not judging it, it's like ... I could run GM but I couldn't fix a car. It's not  saying one is better than the other.
Pam: Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.
Ryan: What the hell? [Michael closed his laptop]
Michael: Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
Ryan: Yeah I make originals too.
Pam: Shut up!
Michael: Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
Pam: Really!
Ryan: Yeah!
Toby: Not much? What's up with you? [from bathroom above] Nah it's okay. I'm in the bathroom. Hey you been watching Damages this year? It's so good. No, you gotta tune in, it's as good as anything on HBO. [sound of pissing] Hey does blue go with tan?
Michael: Would someone just make the copy?
Toby: I have like, like a blue shirt? I don't wear a lot of colors, I have a lot of tan. Uh huh.
Michael: Just make that copy okay?
Pam: Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?
Ryan: That's me and my friend Jonathan from Thailand.
Pam: I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.
Ryan: You could be hot too if you made any effort. At all.
Pam: Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?
Ryan: This is from the sun.
Pam: Oh yeah I bet.
Michael: They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
Pam: Michael, we can hear you.
Michael: I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
Pam: Okay it's my turn.
Ryan: No don't take that, give that back!
Pam: Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?
Ryan: I'm gonna make a spreadsheet.
Pam: You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.'
Ryan: Yeah!
Pam: Yeah exactly. It's my turn.
Ryan: Go make a copy, secretary.
Pam: Come on! Ryan!
Michael: They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?
Dwight: Hey buddy, what are you up to?
Andy: Um, nerthing?
Dwight: Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Andy: Pffft.
Dwight: Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
Andy: The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.
Dwight: And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
Andy: No, that's ridiculous.
Dwight: No no no.
Andy: Look you've been here longer, and besides, I'm a better wingman than I am a boyfriend so-
Dwight: Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.
Michael: Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.
Pam: Definitely.
Michael: Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam: We could work from home.
Ryan: Or you could fire one of us. Whoever has less education.
Michael: Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
Pam: .... Corner idea?
Michael: No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'
Ryan: Rock the house!
Pam: How would we know that?
Jim: Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?
Oscar: Use it in a sentence.
Jim: Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]
Oscar: Try another sentence.
Jim: This rundown better be really good'?
Oscar: I don't know but it sounds like the rundown is really important.
Jim: Charles asked me to do this rundown of all my clients.
Oscar: Why don't you just ask him--
Jim: No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
Oscar: What have you been doing?
Kevin: Try it in another sentence.
Ryan: Last night was crazy. Jojo? Yeah. He did a donut in a parking lot in front of a cop. And then he yells, 'Hey cop, you like donuts?' then we drive off. No, he just stayed there. [Pam goes to sit in a chair in the corner.] I want that new phone. No, the other one. No the other one. No, you know which one I'm talking about it's the one, the one with the awesome browser. [More bathroom noises] No, not that one.
Michael: That's my corner.
Pam: I thought that was your corner.
Michael: No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Pam: So my corner's the one with the copier?
Michael: Pam, I don't make the rules. [Pam walks out.]
Ryan: Yeah. I wish my iPod could make phone calls. No I don't want an iPhone, I know what an iPhone is.
Charles: You started on that rundown yet?  [Looks at Jim's screen.]
Jim: Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
Charles: Oh.
Jim: I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Charles: Okay, great.
Jim: Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
Charles: Just keep it simple.
Jim: Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Charles: You're working hard? On this?
Jim: No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Charles: Right. I mean why work harder than you should.
Jim: No, I....
Erin: Can I help you?
Pam: No thanks.
Jim: Hey!
Pam: Hey I'm here to see Charles.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Hey Charles.
Charles: Hey Pam.
Pam: I know you're a very busy man so I'll cut right to the chase. I'd like my old job back.
Charles: I don't know what to tell you. The job's been taken.
Pam: Um, well, I could come back as a salesman. I have experience now.
Charles: Um.
Pam: Or I could come back as your personal assistant. You know? Sort your mail, set your appointments. I know all the people.
Charles: Yeah I know.
Pam: Personal shopper?
Charles: No.
Pam: Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.
Charles: Okay.
Pam: I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.
Michael: Oh hey! Stanley, Phyllis. Come on in. Welcome, welcome. Let me give you the tour.
Stanley: I get it. [To Phyllis] You need to see more?
Phyllis: It's really cute.
Michael: Thank you. You remember Ryan [Stanley laughs deeply] And Pam is around here somewhere.
Stanley: She's upstairs talking to Charles.
Michael: What for?
Stanley: I don't know. [They shrug and leave.]
Ryan: Are we staying til five?
Michael: Yes.
Michael: Maybe the Michael Scott Paper Company was a huge mistake. I should leave. I should go, and start my own paper company. That'll show 'em.
Michael: Get your free pancakes. They are delicious. They are nutritious. They are complimentary. [Flips a pancake. It's about 8x11 inches] Young sir, would you like a free pancake?
Ryan: I'm texting. I don't want to get my fingers sticky.
Michael: Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
Michael: Hey Pam.
Pam: Hey.
Michael: You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Pam: Yeah, I needed to take care of some stuff.
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: That's as specific as I'd like to be.
Michael: Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
Jim: There's the rundown you asked for. I may have expanded some areas that you weren't prepared for.
Charles: Great. Fax that to everyone on the distribution list.
Jim: Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Charles: Do I need to?
Jim: No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Charles: What's that?
Jim: The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
Jim: Just faxing. My Dad. A rundown.
Pam: We're small, but we're eager to make a name for ourselves.
Man: Do you have a card?
Pam: Nope, I don't have a card, but I'll do you one better. A little scrap of paper.
Creed: These are terrible boss. You gotta make them in a circle so that they cook evenly.
Michael: These are shaped like paper.
Creed: Well I don't even want these. [Takes the rectangle pancakes out of his coat.]
Meredith: I'll take them for my kid.
Erin: Country roads, take me home, to the place...[Dwight is strumming the tune on his guitar] Sorry. I like that song. You're good!
Dwight: You're good.
Erin: Thank you.
Andy: That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]
Erin: Wow!
Andy: What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.
Dwight: Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
Andy: Really?
Dwight: Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven...
Dwight and Erin: West Virginia, Blue Ridge mountain, Shenandoah River [Andy vocalizes]
Dwight: In German! Leben ist dort alt, alter als die Baume, Junger als die Berge, wie eine Brise blasend
Dwight and Andy: Take me home, country roads, to the place, I belong. West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads. [Erin leaves]
Dwight: Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah duh
Toby: You have to stop. [bangs on glass window]
Michael: I once had a dream. That I was eating a peanut butter and tuna fish sandwich. And, let me tell you something it was delicious. So the next day, I decided to make that sandwich. And in real life it is disgusting. [The phone rings] It is a disgusting sandwich. [It rings again.] And the reason I tell you this story. [phone] Pick up the phone.
Pam: Dunder Miff...Michael Scott Paper Company, this is Pam. Oh, hi Russell from the pancake luncheon, how are you? Well we'd like to do business with you too! How can we make that happen?
Ryan: Keep going. [Whispers]
Michael: Don't tell them we have free delivery! [Also whispers]
Pam: We already offered free delivery!
Michael: They don't know that!
Pam: Um, I can offer you free delivery on any order that you place today. Okay, twenty boxes? I can do... just a second. I can do 20 boxes at 43 dollars a box. Great!
Ryan: Write it down.
Michael: Give him a guarantee.
Pam: A guarantee of what?
Michael: Just say the word.
Pam: And I guarantee, that you will be satisfied! 'Cause your satisfaction is our guarantee! We guarantee it. We look forward to doing business with you too. Thank you Russell.
Michael: Yes!
Pam: I made a sale!
Ryan: Oh!
Michael: You did!
Pam: Oh!
Michael: Oh yeah!
Ryan: We did it !
Michael: She did it!
Michael: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office]
Michael: Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.
Andy: Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.
Dwight: Cherry Pie, Warrant.
Andy: Better a cappella!
Dwight: No! Really?
Andy: Yeah. Name another.
Dwight: Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Andy: Better a cappella.
Dwight: Rebel Yell, Billy Idol
Andy: Aw!! Way better a cappella
Dwight: Really?
Andy: Yeah.
Michael: Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth]
Pam: Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.
Michael: Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth]
Pam: We're getting pretty good at it.
Jim: Andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with Angela, but then she was sleeping with Dwight for... several years. Wait, no, that can't be right.
Pam: The timeline's messy.
Jim: Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
Andy: This is my solo. [stereo plays Andy imitating bass guitar, a cappella starts singing 'You Can Call Me Al']
Pam: I'm confused. Am I walking down the aisle to 'You Can Call Me Al?'
Andy: Trust me. You will not be walking. You will be boogie-ing.
Jim: I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
Andy: Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.
Pam: I don't know. It seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to.
Andy: Did you even hear the music I just played for you?
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Phyllis: What's wrong with you?
Dwight: These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
Phyllis: I think you look nice.
Dwight: Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
Charles: Looking good.
Dwight: Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket! [knocks things off shelf with arms] Okay.
Dwight: When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.
Michael: Hey.
Dwight: Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Michael: [gestures to 'Bed & Breakfast' magazine] Is this good?
Dwight: They have some great kitchen ideas.
Michael: Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
Dwight: It's small, I know.
Michael: I really appreciate it.
Dwight: Thanks, Michael. [Michael palms Dwight cash in their handshake] Wait, what is this?
Michael: It's for your trouble.
Dwight: Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Michael: No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
Dwight: Michael, you know I can't take this.
Michael: Yes, I do.
Dwight: But don't forget you owe me $10.
Michael: That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Dwight: Michael.
Andy: What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?
Jim: I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
Andy: It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.
Jim: Am I going down a road?
Andy: When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.
Jim: It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Andy: I know a few things about love.  Horrible, terrible, awful, awful things.
Jim: I was going to use today to purge my inbox, but now something much more pressing has come up.
Michael: Ed's Tires. Why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients, so we can spend more time with each of them. Also, try to discuss it over Indian food, and try to mention how you distrust women.
Pam: I'm not gonna do that.
Michael: That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Ryan: I can get there.
Michael: Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
Ryan: Oh, awesome.
Michael: Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat]
Michael, Pam & Ryan: U-G-L-Y, you ain't got no alibi! You ugly, huh huh, you ugly! You mama says you ugly! Hey! Go Michael Scott Paper Company!
Pam: I'm here. I'm a part of this now.
Dwight: You needed to speak to me?
Charles: Dwight, take a seat.
Dwight: I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
Charles: Nah, that's weird. You're gonna sit. [Dwight sits] Great. You know, Dwight, it has been quite a transition for all of us. Are you happy with the way things have been runnin' lately?
Dwight: Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
Charles: I've just been impressed with your performance and I wanted to make sure good work doesn't go unnoticed.
Dwight: Your concern is noted.
Charles: Yeah, I like your work ethic. You're so... focused.
Dwight: Like a wolf. Thank you.
Charles: And I wanna start givin' you more responsibility. What do you say you and I go out for a drink this week?
Dwight: Really?
Charles: Definitely.
Dwight: [sighs] It's firm.
Michael: [on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.
Dwight: I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
Michael: Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
Dwight: No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.
Michael: I'm not following you.
Dwight: Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
Michael: Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
Dwight: Good, do you see what I'm saying?
Michael: Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
Dwight: No.
Michael: Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!']
Dwight: No.
Michael: [Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?
Dwight: It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Michael: Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Dwight: It is the situation that we are in now.
Michael: So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Dwight: I'm not a barbarian.
Michael: Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
Dwight: I will.
Michael: Dwight?
Dwight: Yes?
Michael: Is the cool new guy Charles?
Dwight: I've said too much.
Michael: Is it Stanley?
Jim: Hey, Andy. You know I've been thinkin about what you said-
Andy: Noishe.'
Jim: -I just don't know if I can do it.
Andy: That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?
Jim: It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
Andy: And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?
Jim: [both laugh] You know that I was doin' this.
Andy: [fist pound each other] Totally.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Hello, Dwight. What's with the shirt? Are you alright?
Dwight: I'm sorry, Michael
Charles: [Charles comes from around corner] Hi, Michael.
Michael: Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
Charles: No, Mich-Michael.
Michael: Dwight, run!
Charles: Michael, no, let's be cool, ok?
Michael: You be cool.
Charles: Yes.
Michael: Just-what's going on?
Charles: We need to talk about our two companies, and how we should behave. Dwight tells me you've been pestering him for company info.
Michael: Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Charles: He did.
Dwight: I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it.
Charles: Michael, I want you to stop pestering my salesmen, and I want you to leave Dunder Mifflin alone. Do you understand?
Michael: I. Understand. Nothing.
Michael: [Michael storms into office] Wow.
Pam: Michael, are you alright?
Michael: It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Pam: Tell us what you're talking about.
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
Pam: We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.
Michael: I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
Andy: Hey, Jim.
Jim: [Jim slams lunchbag on table] I just totally blew a sales call.
Andy: Bro, I do that all the time.
Jim: Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
Andy: Tuna, be nice to my friend Jim, ok?
Jim: Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Andy: Well, so what?  Your body's a ten.
Jim: Forget it.
Andy: Jim.
Jim: I said forget it. [drop kicks lunch across room, stomps on it]
Dwight: [on phone] Dwight Schrute.
Michael: Hello, traitor.
Dwight: I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
Michael: I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
Pam: Michael!
Michael: I'm just getting hardcore with him.
Ryan: Finally.
Michael: Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out. [hangs up] Bill Cosby.
Dwight: [on phone] Mr. Schofield, please?
Secretary: He's in a meeting.
Dwight: Dammit! [hangs up]
Michael: [on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?
Automated phone voice: If you'd like to reach an outside line, please dial nine first. [Michael sighs, hangs up phone]
Stanley: So, you think Michael's going after the whale, huh?
Dwight: I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
Phyllis: You sound worried.
Dwight: And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations! [gibberish sounds]
Michael: [on phone] Well, if you could do me a big favor and tell Mr. Schofield that Michael Scott has tickets to the Wilkes-Barre Penguins game this weekend, and if he would like to join me... Hello, Daniel. How are you? Uh-huh. I sure do. Yes. [referencing rolodex card] Wanted to ask, did Kathy ever make JV?
Ryan: Look at that old dude and his rolodex go.
Pam: I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.
Michael: Wow. High score?
Dwight: And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.
Dwight: Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...
Michael: Hello, Dwight, I've been expecting your call. What do you want?
Dwight: I would like to arrange a truce.
Michael: So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
Dwight: Meet me in our spot in four minutes.
Michael: No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
Dwight: In which direction?
Michael: Toward the sun.
Dwight: At what time?
Michael: Noon.
Dwight: That-
Michael: You have two seconds. [Dwight starts running]
Dwight: [looking at his watch] Michael. [Madge walks by] Sorry.
Michael: Dwight.
Dwight: Michael.
Michael: I hope you're not recording this conversation. [Dwight drops his pants and lifts up his shirt] Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
Dwight: You were making me do things that were not all right.
Michael: So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
Dwight: And not come through for you?
Michael: If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
Dwight: I want a truce.
Michael: I do too.
Dwight: Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's.
Michael: Cooper's.
Dwight: I had fish yesterday.
Michael: Damn it.
Michael: [Michael, Ryan and Pam sitting at restaurant, phone rings] Oh. Dwight-elicious. Where you at?
Dwight: Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
Michael: Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
Dwight: I hit a bear.
Michael: What?
Dwight: He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?
Michael: Yeah, sure.
Dwight: Ok, I will see you very soon, alright? [takes all the items off Michael's desk and puts them into briefcase, including rolodex]
Michael: Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
Pam: [Pam, Ryan and Michael enter office] Sounds neat.
Ryan: We can spend a couple days there.
Pam: Oh my God, I think we've been robbed!
Michael: [Michael answers phone] Yeah.
Dwight: Did you enjoy your lunch?
Michael: Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
Dwight: No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Michael: No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic. [Pam holds up sign saying 'Dwight did it!!'] You?
Dwight: Me.
Michael: What about our truce?
Dwight: I broke it.
Michael: On purpose?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: Why?
Dwight: You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
Michael: Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
Dwight: And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
Michael: Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!
Dwight: Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.
Dwight: [holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'
Dwight: And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.
Michael: Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
Dwight: Sure. That'd be fine.
Michael: If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
Dwight: This is war and that is what happens.
Michael: Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
Dwight: Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
Michael: Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
Dwight: Michael! Michael!
Michael: You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Secretary: Mr. Schofield's ready to see you now, Mr. Scott.
Michael: Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
Dwight: Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Michael: Walking in the door...
Mr. Schofield: Michael, good to see you.
Michael: Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]
Michael: [on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.
Mr. Schofield: Really?
Michael: Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Dwight: Are you saying you invented paper?
Andy: [hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.
Jim: Oh, God.
Andy: Okay, Tuna.
Kelly: Hey, guys.
Jim: Hey.
Andy: Hello.
Andy: Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.
Kevin: I guess I could be nicer.
Phyllis: Andy, I think Jim is messing with you.
Andy: Oh, really?
Phyllis: Mm-hmm. [looks over to Jim smiling through windows to the kitchen]
Jim: Okay.
Andy: Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?
Jim: Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.
Andy: Uh, that's not what was-
Jim: And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Andy: Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.
Michael: What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?
Dwight: It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office]
Secretary: Uh, hello, Dwight.
Dwight: Spin move.
Secretary: Oh-
Dwight: Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.
Mr. Schofield: Dwight, I'm in a meeting.
Michael: That's very rude.
Dwight: I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.
Mr. Schofield: Maybe we should schedule a meeting on our-
Dwight: La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
Michael: I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
Dwight: Come on.
Michael: Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
Dwight: What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.
Mr. Schofield: Why don't you guys just e-mail me your best offers and we can finish it up that way?
Michael: That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
Mr. Schofield: Uh, ok, sure.
Michael: Good, good, good. I will see you.
Dwight: Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?
Mr. Schofield: Excuse me?
Michael: I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'
Dwight: How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?
Michael: I wanted to start a company, not a war. Because in a war, you always fight those you are closest to. And the great tragedy of the civil war is that brother fought against brother. For what? What purpose did that serve? Apart from abolishing slavery? In that case, war was the right choice. This doesn't feel as important though. That's just how the world works, I guess.
Michael: He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.
Michael: Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.
Ryan: Uncle Dave?
Michael: He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
Ryan: That's my family. When you mess with my family, I can't be responsible for my actions.
Pam: When are you ever responsible for your actions?
Ryan: Get off my ass, you hag.
Michael: Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
Michael: Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.
Andy: Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.
Pam: It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?
Andy: Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.
Jim: When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Andy: Yes!
Pam: I don't think so, Andy.
Jim: Sorry. Her day.
Andy: Hey, bud.
Jim: Are they looking at me?
Andy: Who?
Jim: Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Andy: Are you sure?
Jim: Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Michael: It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.
Michael: [honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!
Ryan: We've been making 5:00 AM deliveries for a couple weeks now.  Ever since I've gotten clean there's something about fresh morning air that... just really makes me sick.
Michael: Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.
Pam: We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.
Pam: You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?
Michael: Milk and sugar.
Pam: Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?
Michael: That's what I said.
Pam: Do you drink this every day?
Michael: Every morning.
Michael: We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.
Pam: [an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.
Charles: Okay, who covers Bans Pet Grooming?
Jim: Oh, they're my client.
Charles: No, they were your client.  They just called and told us they're switching over to Michael Scott Paper Company.
Dwight: [sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
Charles: In the last month we have lost ten major clients to Michael Scott.
Stanley: What are we supposed to do?  They keep undercutting us on price.
Charles: I don't want to hear excuses.  I want to see improvements.  This is unacceptable.
Andy: Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.
Charles: Why are you telling me this?
Andy: I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.
Charles: Is this something you really want to have said?
Andy: I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.
Charles: I don't know what to do to inspire these people. Okay, maybe it's my fault-
Dwight: It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
Charles: I wrote a memo to all departments asking them to find ways to save money but, uh--
Angela: Charles, I got your memo. Thank you. I want you to know I'm putting my foot down when it comes to expense reports.  Waste not, want not.
Charles: Uh, well said, Angela.
Dwight: Been there, done that.
Michael: You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.
Ryan: Michael, we should really consider getting a delivery guy.
Michael: Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
Pam: Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?
Michael: Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.
Pam: Yeah, I know what a loft is.
Ryan: Most dorm rooms don't even have that.
Michael: Most do in the magazines.
Ryan: Let's see what a delivery guy costs.
Michael: We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
David Wallace: Would you let Charles know that David is here, please?  Jim, hey.
Jim: Hey, David.
Dwight: David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
Charles: There he is. There he is.  How was the trip up?
David: A lot better than a month at the Scranton Radisson, I'm sure.
Charles: Oh, you know it hasn't been that bad.  Hasn't been that bad.  These people are the salt of the earth down here.  You couldn't ask for a better way to learn a company.
David: Hmmm.
Charles: I feel like I should be thanking you.
David: Uh.
Jim: [makes kissing, puckering sound]
Charles: The conference room is ready if we want to get started.
David: You know, I just want to address everyone first.
Charles: Oh yeah, take your time.  Stanley, pay attention.
David: Hi, everyone.
Kelly: Hi.
David: Hi.  Uh, look it's no secret--
Kevin: Hi.
David: Hello.  Uh, it is no secret that Michael Scott Paper has siphoned off a large chunk of our core business.  And I'm here-- I just want to assure everyone that we think this is just a temporary setback.
Charles: Right.
David: Okay?
Phyllis: Maybe, and I don't know, if you had just returned Michael's call none of us would've lost clients.
David: I've been wondering that myself lately.  We're just gonna get started, we're gonna figure this out. Rest assured.  Jim, can you come in with us please?
Charles: Uh, Jim hold on. [whispers] You know, David, uh, Dwight's been my guy.  Okay?
David: Hmm.
Charles: Yeah, Jim--
David: I find that extraordinarily surprising.
Charles: He shows promise and Jim, I don't know-- I-- he's been a disappointment.
David: We'll bring them both in.
Charles: Okay, great.  Uh, Dwight come on in.  Also, Jim.
Dwight: Come along, afterthought.
Michael: How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?
Financial Guy: Well, if these numbers you gave me are correct--
Michael: They are correct, sir.
Financial Guy: Then you can't afford to pay him anything.
Michael: Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.
Financial Guy: Your prices are too low.
Michael: Lowest in town.
Financial Guy: Why do you think Staples and Dunder Mifflin can't match your prices?
Pam: Corporate greed?
Ryan: Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself.  Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.
Financial Guy: Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct.
Ryan: Yeah.
Financial Guy: But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.
Michael: Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
Ryan: Explain what you think that is.
Financial Guy: Okay.
Michael: Explain that.
Financial Guy: As you sell more paper and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, delivery man, health care...
Michael: Well, we don't--
Financial Guy: ...business expansion--
Michael: Whatever, yeah.
Financial Guy: At these prices, the more paper you sell, the less money you'll make.
Michael: Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
Financial Guy: They're actually putting you out of business.
Michael: Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Ty: It's a program.  There's no such thing--
Michael: Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.
Ty: [presses key on computer] Crunch.
Pam: Did it help?
Michael: Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.
Pam: When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'
Jim: Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?
Charles: God, no.
Dwight: Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
Charles: I agree.
Dwight: I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.
Jim: Really? Does he do good work or--
Dwight: [scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]
David: Fellas, why don't we take a five-minute break and then we will come back, start fresh, sort this out.
Dwight: Five minutes exactly.
Charles: Okay.  Hey, Dwight.  Can I talk to you?
Dwight: Sure thing.
Charles: Yeah.
Jim: [opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.
Jim : You're just out of business?
Pam: We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Jim: Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.
Pam: That's what Michael said.
Jim: Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.
Pam: I like it.
Jim: Good, right?  Hello.
Dwight: [over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
Jim: Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.
Michael: Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?
Pam: Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.
Michael: I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.
Pam: You want to hear something sad?
Michael: I would love that.
Pam: So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.
Ryan: I never went to Thailand.
Pam: Really?
Ryan: I went to Fort Lauderdale.
Michael: Was it nice?
Ryan: Yeah, it was amazing.  There was a great Pad Thai place, though.
Michael: I love Pad Thai.
Ryan: You've never had Pad Thai.
Michael: No.  There's a lot I haven't done.
Jim: Now, this is the projection over three months?
Charles: We still have the inventory sitting-- [everyone starts chattering at once]
Dwight: Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?
David: Yeah, yeah.
Dwight: There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
David: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the cheapest option... is to make Michael an offer.
Charles: Yes.  Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.  We should buy him out.
Jim: Oh, but you didn't.
Dwight: Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.
Charles: What is wrong with you?
David: Jim, you're-- you're pretty close with him.  You think they'd be up for hearing an offer?
Jim: Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--
David: Yeah.
Jim: I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Dwight: You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
Charles: No, Jim... I think you should go.
Jim: Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
Michael: [knocking on door] Hmm?
Jim: Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Michael: We're not hiring, Jim.
Jim: Actually here for something else.
Michael: Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
Jim: You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.
Ryan: Oh, that's nice.
Jim: David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Pam: Seriously?  Are you being serious?
Ryan: He's bluffing, Pam.
Michael: Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
Jim: Oh!
Michael: No-- We don't have--
Jim: Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.
Michael: [stammers] Uh... Yes.
Pam: Yes.
Ryan: Maybe.
Jim: Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
Michael: Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
Jim: Missed the last part.
Michael: That's a pun.
Jim: Got it.
Michael: Yep. Oh... wow.
Ryan: Okay, so you are not going to reveal  in any way that we're broke.
Michael: Of course not.
Ryan: That we're having any problem at all.
Michael: Nope, nope, nope.
Pam: Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.
Michael: Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
Michael: Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.
Pam: No, Michael.
Michael: Ah...
Ryan: No, man.  You're-- you're fine.
Pam: We have to come from a position of strength.
Michael: I'm good, I'm good.
Ryan: Just put it out of your mind.
Michael: It is.  I'm good.
Michael: Hello.
Erin: Hi.
Michael: Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables...
David: Michael, in order to expedite these negotiations, we are prepared to make you a very generous offer.
Michael: And we are prepared to reject that offer.
Ryan: Michael, you  haven't even heard--
Michael: Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?
David: $12,000.00
Michael: Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
Angela: What do you hear?
Kelly: [mumbles]
David: Here's the situation.  Your company is four weeks old.  I know this business.  I know what suppliers are charging.  I know you can't be making very much money.  I don't know how your prices are so low, but I know it can't keep up that way.  I'm sure you're scared.  Probably in debt. This is the best offer you're gonna get.
Michael: I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation.  Your company is losing clients left and right.  You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding.  So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO.  So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin.  I think I just have to wait out you.
David: Okay, now I don't know that I can get this. I do have to go to the board for approval. How's about $60,000.  Hmm?  $60,0000.  Michael?
Michael: [stutters] We'll have to talk--
Charles: What?
Ryan: We'll have to talk about this.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Just amongst ourselves.
David: Okay, yes. Please take the room. Be right outside.  Take your time.
Michael: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Pam: $60,000.00
Michael: We are so rich.
Pam: Are you kidding me?
Dwight: Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.
Charles: Dwight.
Dwight: May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.
Charles: What?  How'd you hear that?
Dwight: They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
Jim: Great work Dwight.
Dwight: Quiet you.
Jim: No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Dwight: You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.
Charles: So how long can they stay viable?
Jim: What are your top five cases?
Dwight: I'm gonna answer Charles first.
Jim: Because you've solved zero cases.
Dwight: Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.
Charles: Okay, do  not go anywhere near the conference room.
Dwight: Done.
Charles: Because you have embarrassed me for the last time today.  Got it?
Dwight: I'm not-- I'm not following you.
Charles: You two are morons.
Jim: Got it.
Dwight: Wh--
Charles: Get out.
David: So you've thought it over, yes, and you accept our offer.  We can finally put this whole thing behind us?  Hmm?
Michael: No.
Pam: Can you give us another minute please?
David: Yeah.
Charles: Oh, okay.
Pam: Michael.
Ryan: How could you do this to me, Michael?  You just cost me $60,000.
Pam: Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?
Michael: It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
Ryan: I would rather have $60,000, honestly.
Pam: No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.
Michael: Agreed?
Pam: Agreed.  But that's all, okay.
Ryan: Yeah, discuss these things--
Michael: Shut up, shut up.  Hello?
Michael: I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.
Charles: They don't make them anymore.
Michael: And I want Charles gone.
David: I am not firing Charles.  He is very valuable.
Charles: That's very kind of you to say, David.
Michael: I need him gone.
David: No.
Michael: Okay, then I want Pam back.
David: Uh, you already have a new receptionist--
Michael: Sales.
Pam: Thank you.
David: Pam's not a salesperson.
Michael: Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
Pam: That's right.
David: Okay.  Please continue.
Michael: And Ryan.
David: Ryan cost Dunder Mifflin hundreds of thousands of dollars, Michael.  Ryan is--
Michael: You know, David.  I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
David: Do you realize what you're asking for here?  You're talking about salary plus health benefits--
Michael: And dental this time.
David: Insurance, taxes, social security for three people.  This is a heck of a lot more than 60 grand.  You're talking about a multi-million dollar buy-out.
Michael: These are our demands.
David: Your company cannot be worth that much.
Michael: Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.
David: Michael--
Michael: That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.
David: Okay.  Deal.  Okay?
Michael: Can we have the room please?
David: Yeah. [David and Charles leave room, Michael shuts the door and closes the blinds]
Ryan: Yes, yes, yes!
Pam: Alright!
Michael: Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!
Michael: There are certain defining moments in a person's life.  The day he is born.  The day he grows hair.  The day he starts a business. And the day he sells that business back to Dunder Mifflin.  What have I learned from all of this?  It is far too early to tell.  I just know that I am flying high and I don't even want to think about it.  I just want to enjoy it.
Charles: Hey, guys--
Michael: No, no. You're done.
Kevin: At least once a year, I like to bring in some of my Kevin's Famous Chili.  The trick is to undercook the onions.  Everybody is going to get to know each other in the pot.  I'm serious about this stuff.  I'm up the night before pressing garlic and dicing whole tomatoes.  I toast my own Ancho chilies.  It's a recipe passed down from Malone's for generations.  It's probably the thing I do best.
Michael: Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?
Ryan: [whispering] Who is it?
Pam: [whispering] Who is it?
Michael: [whispering] It's Michael Scott.  [applause; Michael jumps through sign] Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
Michael: Well, I guess the first order of business is to welcome back me, and Pam and Ryan.  [scattered applause] And how about casual Friday again, huh?  Reinstituting casual Friday?  You all look great.  What I want to do right now is try something a little different.  I'm going to throw it out there, starting with this meeting.  I want you guys to run it.  I want you to say whatever you want,  take it away.  Your meeting.
Dwight: [after a few moments of silence]  Wh--what are you doing?
Michael: If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
Angela: Okay.
Michael: Yes.
Angela: People are dressed inappropriately.
Michael: Take it up with Toby.  What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward.  And I want you to reflect.  And I want you to say something different.
Jim: Can you give us a hint?
Michael: When I needed salespeople for my new paper company,  everyone here turned their back on me.  Am I going to ask them to beg for forgiveness?  No. Am I going to ask for big, crying apology? No.  Am I going to ask them to slit their wrists for me? No.  I just want a tiny, microscopic version of that.
Michael: Oscar, what were you going to say?
Oscar: Nothing.  I didn't say anything.
Michael: All right.
Erin: Do I still have a job here?
Michael: Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
Dwight: Wait, what?
Stanley: How is that going to work?
Michael: It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
Phyllis: You mean the clients you stole from us.
Dwight: Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?
Michael: No, you lost those clients.
Andy: I call foul, sir.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.
Michael: Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.
Meredith: [to Ryan] Don't fall in love with me, kid.
Pam: [laughs]  Boscov's at the Steamtown Mall?
Phyllis: It sure looked good on the mannequin.
Pam: Well, you have good taste.
Phyllis: Well, thanks.  I sure wish I had more time to talk to my clients, though.
Pam: What?
Phyllis: Isn't that what you said to a bunch of my clients when you were stealing them?  That I didn't have enough time for them?
Pam: Oh, I, um...
Phyllis: Close your mouth, sweetie.  You look like a trout.
Angela: The man is wearing sandals.  I don't need to see Oscar's toes at work.  Gross!  I mean he looks like he just got off the boat.
Toby: Can't you just not look at his feet?
Angela: Excuse me? Oh. You're so educated, aren't you Toby?  So trained to deal with a hysterical woman.  I don't want to look at his feet.  [storms off] Do your job!
Toby: Well, I was in the Seminary for a year and dropped out 'cause I wanted to have sex with this girl, Cathy.  Followed her to Scranton.  Took the first job I could find in H.R.  Later she divorced me.  So no, I wouldn't say I have a passion for H.R.
Michael: [hands Ryan a soda] There you are, my friend.
Ryan: Oh, thanks, man.
Michael: Pamela.
Pam: Thank, Michael.
Michael: Yep.
Dwight: Fresh hot ink.
Stanley: New File System'.
Dwight: Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.
Stanley: I am not changing the way I do my files.
Dwight: No, no.  This goes for all of you.  Believe me, you are going to want to heat my words.
Dwight: When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.
Oscar: I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes, but I am not going to drive home to change.
Toby: I could loan you a pair of socks.
Oscar: No.
Toby: No, they're clean.  I was going to wear them to volleyball practice later.
Oscar: I don't think so.
Andy: Andrew Bernard.
Dwight: Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
Andy: What are you still doing not at your desk?
Dwight: Did you even read the memo?
Andy: All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
Dwight: No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.
Andy: Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.
Dwight: Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.
Dwight: We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.
Jim: Can I address that?
Dwight: No, you're too close.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?
Stanley: It's not right.  I don't like it.
Dwight: He doesn't like it.
Phyllis: You don't take my clients away and give them to a secretary.  [sighs] No offense, Jim.  I think she's very pretty.
Dwight: Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?
Meredith: I don't know.  I saw a crowd.  I thought there might be a dogfight or something--
Dwight: Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.
Phyllis: Those sound too harsh.
Dwight: No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.
Jim: Of course.  What is like a hostage?
Dwight: Excellent question.
Andy: We could write a strong-worded letter.
Dwight: Words will never be enough.
Jim: Strongly-painted picture.
Dwight: No, pictures are too interpretive.
Jim: Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.
Dwight: Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.
Jim: Great.  See you upstairs.
Dwight: C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--
Pam: That one's great.
Michael: I know.
Ryan: You look so classy in that picture.
Michael: I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?
Jim: Hey, you have a second?
Michael: Michael Scott Paper Company only.
Jim: Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.
Michael: Okay, well---
Ryan: Tough.
Michael: I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
Jim: This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.
Michael: Against who?
Ryan: You.  Us.
Pam: What?
Ryan: It's gotta be because they all want their clients.
Michael: The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.
Michael: Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.
Pam: Mm-hmmm.
Michael: That was  us, right there.
Pam: We were something else.
Ryan: What you gotta do is you gotta go down to that warehouse and you gotta crack some skulls.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Ryan: Chiklis style.
Michael: Yeah, the Commish.
Ryan: Yes, but Chiklis Shield style.  Not Commish style.
Michael: Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
Creed: It's crazy what's going on out there today, huh?
Jim: I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--
Creed: Sometimes it's best just to say out of it.
Jim: That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.
Creed: Want to play a game?
Michael: Hey gang. Where you been?
Dwight: Lunch.
Michael: Where'd you eat?
Phyllis: A restaurant.
Michael: What'd you have, Stanley?
Andy: I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.
Stanley: I had Mexican food.
Michael: So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.
Ryan: That looks great.
Michael: Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?
Ryan: I can eat.
Michael: I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
Dwight: It's pony.
Michael: Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
Andy: Dijonnaise.
Michael: Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
Pam: Mmm.
Toby: Hey, Meredith.  Can I talk to you privately for a second?
Meredith: About what?
Toby: Your outfit.
Meredith: What? What's wrong with my outfit?
Toby: You--you might consider pulling it down a touch.  It's ri--it's riding up a little high.
Meredith: A bunch of prudes.  You know, Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,  but I'm not allowed to wear open-toed shoes?  [pulls down dress, office gasps]  Is that how it goes?
Oscar: Meredith, your boob is out.
Meredith: Fine.  [pulls dress up, everyone gasps again]
Angela: Meredith, too far!
Kelly: Dammit, Meredith, where are your panties?
Meredith: It's casual day.  Happy?  [bends over to get a file, exposing herself to the office]
Creed: [playing chess with Jim]  No. IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do that, I'm gonna do that.  IF you do this, I'm gonna do that.
Jim: Well, what if I just do this?
Creed: You don't want to do that.
Jim: I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.
Ryan: I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Bart.  Is there anything I can do to make things better?
Dwight: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.
Ryan: Exactly.
Dwight: That's my client.
Ryan: Exactly.  This is your first complaint in ten years.
Dwight: Give me the phone.
Ryan: Things have been generally good.
Dwight: Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.
Ryan: Look, uh, Mr. Bart...
Dwight: Hi, Mr. Bart.
Ryan: At these prices with this service...
Dwight: Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.
Ryan: You're not gonna find this anywhere else.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.
Ryan: No, no, no.  Sir, don't listen.
Dwight: I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!
Phyllis: Ryan, hand the phone over.
Ryan: Stop flustering me, everybody!
Stanley: Who let this boy on the phone?
Dwight: Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Pam: You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.
Dwight: You're a secretary! What do you know?
Ryan: Okay.
Dwight: And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
Michael: Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.
Dwight: We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.
Michael: Who quits?
Phyllis: Me.
Stanley: And me.
Andy: Me too.
Michael: You guys gotta be kidding.
Dwight: No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.
Michael: I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  [throws money at Phyllis] There you go.  There's some seed money for you.  And you can take it, no hard feelings.  But if you stay, I want an apology,  and I want a big one.
Stanley: You want us to apologize to you?
Michael: Yes I do.
Andy: That's completely backwards.
Michael: It's frontward's.
Phyllis: Michael, you thought you were attacking corporate, but we were the ones who got hurt.  You should be apologizing to us.
Stanley: That's right.
Dwight: Right.
Phyllis: Michael, you always said we were a family.  Then you went after us.
Michael: No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.
Michael: I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.
Dwight: Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Michael: Whatever you guys did earlier.
Dwight: I don't know that first things about secret meetings.
Michael: Just do it, okay?
Dwight: I'll do--
Michael: Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.
Dwight: I'll do the best I can.
Michael: Are you kidding me?
Dwight: Deceit does not come easy to me.
Michael: Okay, okay, okay.
Erin: I really love your outfit.
Kelly: Thank you so much for saying that.  I can't believe that Toby thinks this is inappropriate.
Erin: You look like J-Lo.
Michael: So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.
Stanley: Are you giving us our clients back?
Michael: If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
Stanley: Nobody likes that stuff except for you.
Michael: They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
Phyllis: Michael, just give us our clients back.  That's all we care about.
Michael: Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
Stanley: So?
Michael: Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology.
Dwight: That's fair.
Michael: You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
Darryl: What'd I tell you about building forts in my warehouse?
Ryan: Michael gave all of our clients back to their old salespeople, so now there's not enough for both me and Pam to stay on.
Pam: He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.
Ryan: I think you should get it.  You really grew into it.
Pam: Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.
Ryan: If you really think that, will you tell that to Michael?  That would go a long way coming from you.
Pam: Yeah.
Ryan: Thanks.
Creed: So hey, I'm want to set you up with my daughter.
Jim: Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.
Creed: I thought you were gay.
Jim: Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Creed: I don't know.
Michael: Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Jim: Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Michael: [puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
Creed: Challenge.
Michael: I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.
Jim: I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.
Michael: You're close with Pam too.
Jim: Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
Michael: Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
Jim: Well, that's--
Michael: I like his hair.
Jim: Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.
Michael: Okay.
Jim: He definitely stole my iPod.
Michael: That sounds pretty biased.
Jim: You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.
Michael: Okay. Pam, pros.
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Michael: I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
Jim: That's not true.
Michael: I don't need to tell you that.
Jim: I think she'd be a really good salesperson.
Michael: I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
Jim: And I won't.
Michael: Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
Jim: All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.
Michael: Oh, wow!  Whoa!
Jim: Take it easy.
Michael: Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
Michael: I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.
Andy: You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.
Toby: All right, look, what you gotta understand is that when you come to work, you give up certain rights.
Dwight: Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
Toby: All right, come.  Sit down, Dwight.
Dwight: No.
Toby: I'm running this meeting.
Dwight: That's debatable.
Toby: It's not.  It's not.  Sit down or I am writing you up.
Meredith: Ooh, where has this guy been?
Toby: Casual Fridays are cancelled.  [everyone protests]  Let's just not do it anymore.
Andy: You're running from the problem.
Toby: There's not a single appropriate outfit in this whole--except mine, quite honestly.
Michael: Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--
Pam: Just tell me.
Michael: I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
Pam: No, okay.
Michael: I'm sorry, sorry.
Pam: Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?
Michael: [laughing] Yes, you did.
Pam: I did?
Michael: Yep.
Pam: For real, you're not kidding?
Michael: No, you--no.
Pam: I did?
Michael: No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.
Pam: Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.
Michael: [laughing] Oh, oh!
Pam: Thank you.  You will not be sorry.
Michael: You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
Pam: Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.
Michael: Oh, really?
Pam: Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't
Michael: Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.
Pam: What about Ryan?
Michael: I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
Pam: Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.
Michael: I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.
Pam: Thanks, Michael.
Michael: Oh! What's our receptionists name?
Pam: Erin.
Michael: Could you send her in?
Pam: [opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.
Michael: Hello.
Erin: Hi.
Michael: Have a seat.
Michael: This is very difficult to say, but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go.  [pick up phone] Hank, could you come up here please?  Hank is our security guard--
Erin: Oh, I can go.
Michael: He will be ushering you out.  [starts laughing]
Erin: Oh!
Michael: Oh, your face!  Oh!
Erin: Is--do the people--
Michael: No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Erin: Oh!
Michael: Oh...
Erin: Do they not like me, though?
Michael: I don't know, actually.
Erin: Okay.
Erin: Oh my God! I can't believe it! I jut won an art contest! [Erin screams, Pam and Jim look at each other, Dwight, laughing, gets up and hands her some money]
Erin: [whispering] Thanks. I still don't understand why you wanted me to say that.
Dwight: Shut up.
Dwight: [laughs hysterically] I got her!
Pam: Not cool, Dwight. [Dwight continues laughing]
Jim: Not cool. [Dwight still laughing]
Michael: [caught by camera crew dancing to 'At the Car Wash', but laughing] Oh, no. I still have the lease on the Michael Scott Paper Company, so occasionally I will sneak down here for a little coffee and dancing. I actually dance all the time. Tip-toeing around corporate - it is a ballet. When I am breaking all the rules, I am break dancing. And expresso.
Michael: Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?
Dwight: I do.
Michael: Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Pam: Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.
Michael: Oh, really? Ok.
Pam: Just sent it.
Michael: What about the rest of you? [complete silence]
Michael: At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.
Michael: Who else? Who else? Ryan?
Ryan: I don't do lunch. I'm eating five small meals a day now.
Ryan: Now that I'm back to doing the job of a temp, again, I find that food is one thing I can control.
Michael: Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.
Angela: No. I don't want to stay late to have a two hour lunch.
Phyllis: Michael, we have a lot of work to do.
Michael: What?
Phyllis: Work.
Michael: Ugh! God! What happened to you people? [talking like a robot] We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
Pam: If you don't take out his battery, he just keeps going all day.
Pam: Oh, no. Your battery fell out.
Michael: [still talking like a robot] I... was just learning... to... love.
Erin: Hi, guys. How you doing?
Dwight: Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
Erin: Right. I'm sorry.
Dwight: [sighs] Now, how can I help you?
Erin: Did somebody here leave a map in the printer to Youngstown, Ohio?
Dwight: Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -
Pam: So someone is going to a court. Big deal.
Dwight: It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Erin: Sure.
Jim: There are other reasons to go to Ohio.
Pam: We're getting married today.
Jim: So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
Pam: Tell 'em how it happened.
Jim: Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
Pam: And very expensive.
Jim: Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Pam: You can't leave anyone out.
Jim: No one.
Pam: Ok, just get to the good part.
Jim: Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, ' You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you.'
Pam: I had just woken up. I didn't look cute. That's how I knew he meant it.
Erin: Michael? Michael sorry to bother you. Are you going to be working down here? Do you want these down here now?
Michael: No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Erin: Well, I like to swim.
Michael: That's good.
Erin: You have a cool place to come hang.
Michael: If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
Erin: Thanks.
Michael: Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
Erin: Wow.
Michael: Now you got it.
Erin: Now I do got it.
Michael: Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
Erin: Oh, yeah.
Michael: You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Erin: That's rule #1.
Michael: Ok. I love it. I love it.
Erin: Whew.
Michael: I love it.
Michael: Guys, I believe that I have figured out what is up your butts. There's no reason to be scared. The bad man is gone.Charles is gone.
Michael: Charles really did a number on these guys. They are way too focused on work. When I was in charge, this place was like Dave and Buster's People just hanging out, having, fun, eating apps. I don't know. It's like [pause] Dave died or something.
Michael: Daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you.
Oscar: Please don't refer to yourself as our daddy.
Michael: I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Andy: [baby voice] Wittle Andy is afwaid.
Michael: Andy's afwaid?
Andy: Yes.
Michael: Are you all afwaid?
Dwight: No.
Michael: Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Pam: What?
Michael: Funk is the problem and the solution.
Jim: That makes sense.
Michael: I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Oscar: Is this our punishment for not wanting to have lunch with you?
Michael: Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
Dwight: [Jack Nicholson impression] All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Meredith: This is like a haunted coffeehouse thing?
Michael: No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
Andy: It's like a haunted disco.
Michael: ... with coffee but without the haunted.
Phyllis: It's a combo dance house coffee bar.
Michael: It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
Erin: It's a cafe disco.
Michael: Exactly.
Kevin: So, like, a disco cafe?
Michael: Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
Michael: Well, Kevin, I guess it is just me and you.
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Holdin' down the fort.
Kevin: Yeah. This place is great.
Michael: Thank you.
Angela: Oh, my God, Kevin. I am still on hold. You were supposed to get the answer from Michael and come back up.
Kevin: I'm sorry.
Michael: This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Kevin: Yeah. Respect the lei.
Angela: Come.
Michael: Kevin, stay.
Angela: Kevin, come.
Michael: Kevin, stay.
Angela: Kevin, come.
Michael: Stay, stay.
Angela: Come on, right now.
Michael: Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
Angela: Ugh. There is no cookie, Kevin.
Kevin: [to Michael] Is there a cookie?
Michael: Mmm-hmm.
Angela: Wha -
Michael: Come on.
Angela: Oh, for goodness sakes, Kevin. There's no cookie. There's no cookie. Come on. Come.
Kevin: I wanted a cookie.
Angela: Completely unacceptable.
Michael: Now I know what the founders of Phillip-Morris felt like. you just want to give people a smooth, fun way to relax and suddenly you're just some terrible monster.
Andy: [Michael is holding the stereo speaker up to a vent - blaring '[Gonna Make You Sweat] Everybody Dance Now', spins in chair] Oww!
Phyllis: Aw, what the hell? [goes to Vance Refrigeration] Hi, Jessica. Is Bob in?
Jessica: Oh, he's on a call.
Phyllis: Oh, I'll just duck my head in.
Jessica: It's pretty important. He wouldn't want to be disturbed. Can I give him a message before he gets off?
Phyllis: Tell him I'm going dancing downstairs in the storage closet between the bathrooms that used to be a utility shower and he should join me there.
Jessica: I'll let him know.
Phyllis: Mmm-hmm.
Michael: Phyllis?
Phyllis: Hi.
Michael: Hey!
Phyllis: Hey. I like.
Michael: [starts dancing with Phyllis] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
Phyllis: Oh! Mother ******!
Michael: Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Phyllis: Back!
Michael: Oh, wow! What did you do?
Phyllis: [moans in pain]
Michael: You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Phyllis: Wow! Sorry!
Michael: Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
Dwight: Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
Michael: No. No. No.
Dwight: Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Phyllis: It's my back.
Michael: It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
Phyllis: Call a doctor.
Michael: We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
Phyllis: No. Call Bob.
Michael: Oh, no. No. No. This is no good.
Dwight: Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
Michael: I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
Dwight: What do you think history is?
Michael: It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
Michael: [barging through office door] Alright. Here we go.
Dwight: Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Michael: You having fun?
Erin: Oh, my God! What happened?
Michael: What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
Phyllis: What? No. I thought we were going to the hospital.
Dwight: You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Michael: Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
Oscar: What happened to Phyllis?
Michael: Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
Angela: Can you please go back to work instead of masterminding these situations were in we hurt ourselves?
Michael: Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything. [Phyllis can be heard screaming in the backgroud]
Stanley: I would like the memory of a day uninterrupted by this nonsense.
Michael: You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Erin: Yes.
Michael: I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
Erin: Like unplug the coffee machine and bring it up here.
Michael: I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
Dwight: [exits the conference room in an undershirt] I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
Kelly: Cafe Disco? More like Crappe Disco.
Erin: You're bad. [they turn off the lights and turn on music - start dancing]
Vance Refrigeration Guy 1: There's girl in there.
Vance Refrigeration Guy 2: Where?
VRG 1: The other room?
VRG 2: What other room?
VRG 1: Down the hall.
VRG 2: There's girls in there?
VRG 1: What'd I just say?
VRG 2: You have another sandwich?
VRG 1: Forget the sandwich. Girls. Girls.
Michael: I guess they got what they want. I am eating alone. Might as well be dinner.
Dwight: You comfy? Alright? Alright. Relax. Relax, ok?
Phyllis: Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight: Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Phyllis: I do.
Dwight: No kidding! She sits three feet from me. It's the most annoying thing. [mimics grinding teeth] It's like children singing Christmas carols.
Andy: Yeah! I love the vibe down here.
Erin: Ashley! You made it!
Oscar: You invited someone?
Erin: Oh, yeah. Was I not allowed to do that?
Oscar: I've been here 8 years and I've never... [Erin walks away] Rude.
Andy: I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure I'm in a dance off. Alright!
Michael: Cafe Disco is dead but I can still hear the music in my head.
Creed: I hear it, too, Boss.
Michael: It's better than I imagined it!
Phyllis: That feels good, Dwight.
Dwight: Tell me where it hurts.
Phylis: Right... mmmm... right there.
Dwight: Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Michael: Welcome, welcome! Cafe Disco. I am Michael Scott.
Erin: Hey, Angela! Welcome to -
Angela: Stop!
Michael: Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Angela: No. I didn't come down here to get wet and wild. I just need you to sign these.
Michael: Oh. Alright. There you go.
Angela: No. You need to sign them all.
Michael: No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
Angela: Look, I hate to be 'that' person but I just don't like the general spirit of music.
Michael: I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, ' This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you.' [Angela shows Michael the papers again] No.
Dwight: This is oil from the gland of an otter. It keeps their fur water resistant, as well as traps heat. Now I need you to lie still for an hour.
Phyllis: An hour? I can't stay here an hour.
Dwight: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
Creed: Boss, this used to hang from my windshield but it belongs in here.
Michael: Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
Creed: No problem. I'll just have no idea who's driving behind me now.
Dwight: I'm gonna with the python.
Phyllis: But the rattler's so scary.
Dwight: No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.
Phyllis: I think Bob is gonna cheat on me with his new secretary. [she starts to giggle]
Dwight: What's so funny?
Phyllis: When I say it out loud it's so silly. [they both laugh]
Michael: Hey! Hey! Angela, no! No cleaning up!
Angela: You are forcing me to be down here. Am I not allowed to have some fun?
Michael: No... cleaning... up.
Jim: [waiting outside the bathroom for Pam, he is holding a hand-picked bouquet of flowers and pacing] These are for you.
Pam: They're beautiful.
Jim: You ready?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: We should probably stop by. It'd mean a lot to him.
Michael: Hey! Hey! Jim and Pam! Can you believe this? It's really happening.
Phyllis: Wanna dance, Dwight?
Dwight: Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.
Bob Vance: Mind if I steal my wife?
Dwight: You can't steal what is legally your property.
Bob Vance: Are those staples?
Andy: This dance competition is not over.
Kelly: What dance competition? I was just dancin' casual with my friends, y'all.
Michael: You guys are the best for coming. You don't have to stay if you don't want to. I understand.
Jim: We're gonna stay.
Michael: Really?
Jim: Yeah. At least for one more dance.
Michael: Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco! [Dwight hits Michael in ear] Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to 'Y'.
Pam: This is so cheesy.
Jim: Yes.
Pam: I like cheesy.
Jim: Me, too.
Pam: Yeah. I think maybe I want a 'wedding' wedding.
Jim: Me, too.
Pam: Really?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Would you like to dance?
Angela: No. [Camera pans to down to show her swinging her foot to the music]
Andy: Yeah. No. Well, ok.
Kelly: Stop squirming.
Andy: Well, stop trying to poke me with a sharp thing.
Kelly: You wanted to do this. Just be brave.
Andy: I, I - but you're not a professional and I'm thinking maybe we should have gone to a professional.
Kelly: I'm doing it. No. I'm doing it for free. You have to stop squirming otherwise I'm gonna mess up.
Andy: Are you sure that's not the 'gay' ear?
Kelly: Gay ear? Are you 12 years old?
Andy: Well, I...
Kelly: Look, I'm gonna count to 3.
Andy: Count to twen - count to twenty.
Kelly: No. I'm gonna count to 3.
Andy: K
Kelly: 1... 2... 3
Andy: Agh! Son of a bitch!
Kelly: Andy, that was just the ice.
Andy: It was?
Kelly: Yeah. It was.
Lynn: Hey, Kevin.
Kevin: Hi. Did you have bacon for breakfast?
Lynn: No.
Kevin: Oh...cause you smell like bacon.
Lynn: I didn't think I did. How's everything going?
Kevin: Tight. I'm going down the hall to this office to see Michael - there's free espressos.
Lynn: Oh.
Kevin: I would invite you but I remember that you just want to be friends.
Lynn: We can still...
Kevin: Are you sure that you didn't eat bacon?
Lynn: Yes.
Kevin: Oh. Whatever it is I like it. Bye.
Lynn: Yes, I had some bacon this morning. I just didn't think it was anyone's business.
Kevin: I love the smell of bacon on a woman.
Kevin: Hey, Lynn, it's Kevin. I was thinking about going and getting a coffee at the Cafe Disco, wondering if you want to go with. Bye. Angela, my stomach is really hurting.
Oscar: Just go down, Kevin.
Michael: My grandpa was the funnest guy I ever knew. He would sing. He would dance. He would....fall down. But then...he started going to these meetings and everything changed. He...stopped going out at night. He got a job. The fun just dried up. It was really sad. I don't want that to happen to you guys. I'm not gonna let it happen.
Stanley: How did I end up back in Crazytown?
Dwight: It is hard to imagine you playing softball.
Phyllis: I was all-county my junior and senior years.
Dwight: Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
Phyllis: The girls school?
Dwight: I played high school softball. Notice I didn't say 'girls' high school softball. Not after the landmark case of Shrute vs. the Lackawanna County Board of Education.That was one case the Pennsylvania Supreme Court got right. I hit the ball right over the protest banners.
Dwight: [sarcastically] Oh, no. I love Ohio. Next time you're there say 'Hi' to my cousin Amel and then kick him in the groin area because he's a cheat and a ball hog. And if he's still married to Clarissa, kick her in the groin area, too. 'Cause she's a heart breaking tart...and a ball hog.
Erin: [phone rings, whispering]  Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin... He's not available right now... Uh huh... Yes... Sure, I'll give him the message when he gets up-- gets back.
Jim: Michael had chicken potpie for lunch. Actually, let me rephrase that, Michael had an entire chicken pot pie for lunch, and- let me be more specific. Michael ate an entire family-sized chicken potpie for lunch and then he promptly fell asleep, so we're all trying to be very quiet so as to not wake him up before 5:00 pm. Which, actually, should be in about... ten minutes.
Jim: [whispering] Okay, I'm gonna go in there and change the computer. Are you sure you can change his watch?
Pam: [whispering] I can do it.
Dwight: [whispering] What do you need from me?
Dwight: Normally I don't condone leaving early, but I have an appointment with the horse doctor. How that horse became a doctor, I don't know. [laughs heartily] No, I'm kidding. He's just a regular doctor who shoots your horse in the head when its leg is broken.
Michael: [mumbles in his sleep as Pam and Jim change the clocks in his office]
Dwight: [changing the clock in Michael's car] Like clockwork.
Jim: [silently counting] Three, two, one... [Erin turns on the office lights, all laugh loudly]
Michael: [wakes up, joins in with the laughter] Uh oh. What's so funny?
Pam: You had to be there.
Michael: Oh yay! Geography joke. [still laughing, notices the time] Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Michael: See you later!
Dwight: Bye Michael! [all applaud and cheer, Dwight imitates gunfire] Yeah!
Jim: [at company picnic] All right, you ready for this?
Pam: Yeah, we walk around, everyone sees our faces and we leave, right?
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Wait, should I have left the car running? [both laugh]
Pam: Oh, don't get us wrong, we like picnics.
Jim: Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
Pam: Tell them what happened last year.
Jim: I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Pam: No, no, that guy who hit on me.
Jim: Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
Pam: Yeah, you don't grab these [gestures to her chest] for balance.
Jim: Well...
Dwight: I'm gonna say 30.
Rolph: Ah, 40. Insect repellent, which we clearly need, reduces the effectiveness of SPF.
Dwight: Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Rolph: Woah. Homemade?
Dwight: Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET? [both laugh]
Dwight: Rolph is my best friend. We met in a shoe store. I heard him asking for a shoe that could increase his speed and not leave any tracks.
Kevin: Michael, isn't that Holly?
Michael: We're just friends. [approaches Holly and AJ] Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
Holly: Oh no, I see they're letting just anybody in here.
Michael: Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
Holly: All right.
Michael: All right. Mmhmm. [both start laughing and hug] Hey.
Holly: Hi. You remember AJ, my boyfriend?
Michael: A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
AJ: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey. [hugs AJ a little too forcefully] Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
Holly: Lemonade sounds great.
Michael: Okay.
AJ: I'd love an iced tea, actually.
Michael: You can go to hell. [laughs] I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
Michael: I lied to Kevin. Holly and I can never be just friends. I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.
Charles: Jim. Pam.
Jim: Hey, how are you?
Pam: Hey Charles.
Charles: Nice day, huh?
Jim: Yeah.
Charles: Must be nice to get a rest from all your rest. [walks away]
Jim: I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Pam: Do you want me to beat him up for you?
Jim: No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
Dwight: Listen up everyone! I've gone over this lineup very carefully. We cannot forget the humiliation we suffered last year at the softball game with Jim's whole spider-in-the-mitt incident. Right?
Jim: Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Dwight: Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
Andy: Bro-migo, you think you could put Erin on my row?
Dwight: Why? I don't understand.
Andy: If-
Dwight: Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Andy: Uh... [laughs sheepishly]
Dwight: I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Andy: That's...
Dwight: Sly dog.
Andy: ... not what I meant.
Dwight: Come on, folks!
Michael: What is up with you two, Holly?
Holly: Um, not much.
AJ: We're designing a house.
Michael: Cool. For who?
AJ: For us.
Michael: Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
Holly: I remember your chair pants idea. [laughs]
AJ: I like that. Put me down for a pair. I'm a size 34 waist.
Michael: All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
Holly: Okay, yeah.
AJ: You guys are really gonna do this?
Michael: You bet your fat ass we are.
Michael: Well, in his infinite wisdom, David Wallace has authorized us to put on a little presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin.
Holly: Yep, the old comedy team is back together again.
Michael: That's right.
Holly: [in a New York accent] Have ya hoyd the news? Extry! Extry! Read all about it!
Michael: Newspapers for sale!
Andy: [playing volleyball, yelling at Erin, who hit the ball out of bounds] Are you blind?! Are you blind?! [turns attention to a man on the other team] Sir, with the glasses, are you literally blind? I'm concerned you might be in danger.
Man: These are expensive Ray-Bans, jackass.
Andy: Okay, I was just looking out for you. [to Erin] You're doing great, by the way.
Erin: Thanks.
Kevin: [playing volleyball] I got it. [Kevin misses]
Dwight: Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Andy: Are you blind?!
Dwight: I could've gotten that, idiot!
Andy: Can you see things with your eyeballs?!
Dwight: It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
Phyllis: We've been out here for a while. I don't need this.
Dwight: [grunts in frustration]
Dwight: [playing volleyball, Ryan hits the ball away, not paying attention to the game] Oh come- Ryan, come on, man! W-w-wait. Net. Net. Her hand's on the net.
Woman: So what?
Dwight: Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Pam: Back off, Dwight. [serves] Hyuh! [the opposing team misses the ball, the Scranton team cheers] What?
Pam: Maybe I played a little in junior high... and in high school... maybe a little in college... and went to volleyball camp most summers.
Pam: [serves] Hyuh! [other team misses and Scranton cheers] Well, look at that, we win!
Jim: Nice job, Beesly.
Dwight: Yes! We advance to the next round!
Phyllis: Oh, Lord in heaven.
Stanley: [to Phyllis] Had to be part of the group. [laughs]
Michael: I brought some snacky snacks, in case we get hungry.
Holly: Ooh, yes please. [takes a bite] Mmm. So what do you have planned for us today? Hmm?
Michael: [watching her eat] What?
Holly: Do you have a script for the sketch, or...
Michael: Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
Holly: Crystal cool.
Dwight: [playing volleyball] Hit it Andy!
Andy: Bump! I bumped it!
Kevin: Set!
Dwight: Don't set it to yourself!
Kevin: [Pam saves the play and Scranton cheers] Yeah!
Phyllis: Ow, my ankle!
Dwight: What happened?
Phyllis: I... twisted it.
Dwight: You weren't even moving. [Phyllis leaves the court] Okay, sub!
Angela: I can play.
Rolph: Is there a... Meredith here?
Meredith: Yeah! Man in!
Angela: Rolph, did you not hear me?
Rolph: I don't hear cheaters, tramps, or women who break my friend's heart. Let's go!
Michael: We could do a movie... sort of thing.
Holly: [gasps] We could do Back to the Future.
Michael: Oh!
Holly: We have to convince Dunder and Mifflin to go back in time... fix their parents. [both laugh]
Michael: Could we get a Delorean?
Holly: Jaws. They swim in the ocean and they terrorize the whole community.
Michael: Oh! [to the theme of 'Jaws'] Dun-der. Dun-der...
Holly: Dun-der. Dun-der...
Michael: Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!! [both laugh]
Holly: Oh... We haven't found our great idea yet.
Michael: No. No.
Holly: Oh.
Michael: We're circling it.
Holly: Hmm...
David: [playing volleyball, Scranton wins another game] Nicely done. We're still going to crush you though!
Charles: Yes we are!
Rolph: You suckers are goin down! They're gonna wipe their asses with your serves! Piss all over your faces!
Dwight: Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait- [shouts of disapproval]
Rolph: It's true!
Toby: Ah, this reminds me of the HR convention last fall.
Kendall: Oh yeah, with Bernie and Efrem. That was hilarious.
Toby: Really, really funny.
Kendall: Really funny.
Dwight: Listen guys, one more point and we play corporate. [they get the last point, Jim and Dwight hug]
Oscar: Settle down gentlemen.
Pam: Good game!
David: Welcome to the 43rd Annual Company Picnic, everybody. Thanks for being here. Now, a couple of employees have volunteered to entertain us with a song.
Michael: [shouts from behind the trees] Uh, it's a sketch now.
David: Okay, introducing Scranton's Michael Scott performing with Nashua's Holly Flax! I have not seen this. [applause]
Michael: And now, presenting...
Both: SlumDunder Mifflinaire! [laughter]
Michael: [imitates Who Wants To Be a Millionaire theme music as both sit in folding chairs]
Holly: Are you ready to play SlumDunder Mifflinaire?
Michael: Yes, I am.
Holly: For one hundred dollars, where did Dunder meet Mifflin? A.) On easy street, B.) a tour of Dartmouth College, C.) they never met, D.) brushing their teeth?
Michael: Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
Holly: That is correct! [both run to another side of the stage, acting out a different scene] How did you know that?! [pantomimes electrocuting Michael]
Michael: [screams] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Holly: [now pretending to be Dunder and Mifflin] Nice campus. Think you'll get in?
Michael: Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
Holly: I'm Robert Dunder.
Michael: I'm Robert Mifflin. [pause to see audience's response] Ah, okay. [both run back to chairs]
Holly: Robert Mifflin had a great life. But unfortunately, had undiagnosed depression, which over nine million Americans suffer from and is very treatable. For two hundred and fifty dollars, how did he kill himself? A.) A rope, B.) a knife, C.) a gun, D.) brushing his teeth!
Michael: Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
Holly: That is correct!
Michael: Yes!
Stanley: I usually don't enjoy the theater, but this is delightful.
Holly: The economic downturn has been difficult recently, forcing the closures of both Camden and Yonkers, to be followed soon by what other branch? For five-hundred thousand dollars, is it A.) Scranton, B.) Buffalo, C.) Utica, or D.) toothbrush!
Michael: I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
Holly: That is correct!
Man from Buffalo: [over crowd of murmurs] What is he talking about?
Holly: [pantomimes biting off Michael's fingers, Michael screams] How did you know that?!
Michael: David Wallace told me!!
Woman from Buffalo: David, is this true?
David: Uh, okay everyone, we're at a picnic today...
Man from Buffalo: Are we losing our jobs or not, David?
Holly: They didn't know?
Michael: [whispers] I guess not.
David: I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time or the place to announce this sort of thing, but there have been talks about closing the Buffalo branch.
Woman from Buffalo: And?
David: We're- we're closing the Buffalo branch.
Man from Buffalo: [over shouts of protest] You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me! We're the best branch in the company! I can't believe it. [Michael and Holly bow]
David: How could you possibly think that the right way to announce a branch closing was in a comedy sketch at the company picnic?
Michael: Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
David: What about the fact that they're here today? What about that? That didn't throw up any alarms? No, Michael needed a little bit for his comedy sketch, and he thought, 'oh, this would be really funny.'
Michael: Thank you.
David: Damn it, Michael, I told you that in confidence. Now I have to go over and deal with these employees and their families. A little boy just walked up to me and said, 'is my daddy gonna have a job by Christmas?'
Michael: Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
Meredith: Maybe we shouldn't play due to the circumstances.
Dwight: Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
Pam: How do you figure?
Dwight: Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
Oscar: Dwight's right. Corporate deserves to get its ass kicked.
Pam: Let's do this.
Andy: [playing volleyball] Jim, come on! [Jim scores a point, Scranton cheers]
Charles: Look who just woke up! [laughs, scores a point on the next play] I've been up for a while.
Kevin: It's six to six. It's a nail-biter. [ball hits Kevin]
Angela: Kevin! Now it's seven-six, or is that too much accounting for you?
Rolph: Here's an accounting question for you: what does one fiance plus one lover equal? Answer: one whore.
Dwight: Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
Rolph: What? She is sitting there, casting aspersions-
Dwight: Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
Rolph: No way! You don't mean that!
Dwight: Rolph, leave it alone!
Erin: [hits the ball over the net and scores a point] Yeah! Boo-yah!
Pam: [running for the ball] I got it!
Dwight: Pam!
Pam: [falls] Oof!
Jim: You all right?
Pam: Yep. No, no, no, I'm fine.
Jim: You sure?
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Hey, easy, easy...
Charles: Woah, woah, woah, woah, you wanna get that looked at.
Pam: No, no, it's fine. Just gimme a second.
Charles: I don't know. You know, this is a company picnic, so technically that is a company injury, you know? Safest thing to do is get that examined, right David?
David: Yeah.
Jim: All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Charles: Oh, Jim, you're putting a volleyball game in front of your fiance's health.
Jim: No, uh-
Pam: Look, seriously, I can move it fine. Come on, let's go, it's our ball. Let's go!
Charles: Yeah, I don't think we can let you play with that foot.
Dwight: [whispering] Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
Charles: I guess that's it for you, Jim.
Jim: All right, you know what? [picks Pam up and carries her off the court] Let's do this.
Pam: We'll be back!
Dwight: Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!! [kicks volleyball into the woods, calmly] I'll get it. [walks slowly toward the woods]
Michael: Probably shouldn't have mentioned Buffalo.
Holly: Hindsight.
Michael: Should've had hindsight.
Holly: How do you think it went before the Buffalo thing?
Michael: I think it went well. I think it was good.
Holly: There weren't any laughs.
Michael: No, it was a tough audience.
Holly: Yeah, but we wrote it specifically for this audience.
Michael: Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
Holly: Well, I'm glad we did it.
Michael: Me too. [long pause] We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Holly: I can't wait.
Jim: [on the phone] Yeah, she's with the nurse right now, so you'll have to stall a little longer... No, don't send in the subs yet... Dwight, I don't know. Think of something!
Nurse: To be safe, we should do an x-ray.
Pam: How long will that take?
Nurse: Oh, shouldn't be too bad, it's a slow day. So, no other radiation this year, no metal plates, no chance you're pregnant...
Pam: I'm sorry, can we just hurry this up? I've got a game to get back to.
Nurse: Oh good, because my next question was 'do you have a game to get back to.'
Holly: What'd you think?
AJ: I loved it. You know, there was a part near the end that seemed like that went on a little long, but...
Michael: Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Holly: [laughs] Okay. So good to see you.
Michael: Good to see you. [they hug] AJ.
AJ: Michael. [they shake hands]
Michael: I didn't find a perfect moment, because I think that today was just about just having today. And I think that we are one of those couples with a long story, when people ask how they found each other. I will see her every now and then, and... Maybe one year she'll be with somebody, and the next year, I'll be with somebody, and it's gonna take a long time... And then it's perfect. I'm in no rush.
David: Dwight, come on now, it's time to put in the subs.
Charles: Yeah, it looks like Pam won't make it back. Okay?
Dwight: Okay. Fine.
Charles: All right! Come on.
Dwight: Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Andy: Dwight.
Dwight: No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
David: Dwight.
Dwight: Seven? Can I finish please?
David: Okay.
Dwight: Eight?
Jim: [on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great. [goes into a private room where Pam and the doctor are, the voices are inaudible, but the camera can see through a window, Pam and Jim look in shock, they hug and Jim goes back out into the hall to call Dwight back, trembling] Hey, Dwight, uh... send in the subs! [laughs] Ohh! [goes back into the room to hug Pam]
Cookie Monster: [Kevin's voice] Oscar, Toby said he left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair. Have you seen them? Wait I'm sitting on them. [all laugh]
Andy: This is awesome!
Oscar: Thank you. It didn't even take that long.
Cookie Monster: [Kevin's voice] What's the difference between a chimichanga, [Kevin arrives behind the group] a chalupa, and a tostada? Call me back ASAP. It's urgent.
Kevin: This isn't funny. I don't talk like that. [all continue laughing]
Phyllis: Say 'Me eat cookie.'
Kevin: No. I won't say it.
Dwight: Why is everyone clumped around accounting? Break it up, you clique.
Ryan: It's Kevin as Cookie monster from Sesame Street.
Dwight: [gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?
Phyllis: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: I love that show.
Cookie Monster: [Kevin's voice] This is Kevin. This is Kevin.
Ryan: Good work, buddy.
Oscar: Thank you.
Dwight: That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.
Oscar: Yes.
Kelly: Me, too Oscar.
Ryan: C.C. me
Kevin: Angela, this is inappropriate.
Angela: This is my favorite day.
Andy: It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.
Meredith: Here you go.
Erin: Oh, thank you.
Andy: I do.
Dwight: [hands Erin a basket of beets]
Erin: Thank you.
Andy: If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.
Erin: [as Halperts arrive] Welcome back!
Pam: Hey, thanks.
Pam: It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.
Pam: [at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?
Jim: I literally did not know that existed until this moment.
Dwight: Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.
Pam: It's nice to see you again, Dwight.
Dwight.: Hello, Pam.
Andy: [arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
Michael: I'm going to give Erin $15.
Erin: I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
Michael: A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
Andy: Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].
Michael: She's kind of a rube.
Andy: [slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
Michael: Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
Andy: [taping desk] She's gonna be so psyched.
Michael: [walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.
Erin: Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
Michael: I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to...[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.
Erin: I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
Michael: Ugh.
Erin: Just the two of us.
Michael: Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
Erin: Yeah, okay. Yeah that was a stupid suggestion. I was thinking someplace special, so I though Hayworth's, but...
Michael: Okay, well, we'll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]
Erin: Oh.
Michael: [looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
Erin: [cheerfully] Okay.
Michael: All right.
Meredith: [sitting at kitchen table with Darryl] Have a cookie, Kev.
Kevin: Yeah, haha. Tray of cookies. I'm not falling for that.
Darryl: I brought those in. It's my birthday.  That's some stone-cold narcissism right there.
Kevin: Man, Darryl, I'm sorry. [pats Darryl's back] Happy Birthday.
Darryl: Thank you. [Kevin grabs cookie and starts eating it]
Darryl: [as Cookie Monster] Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum, Yum.
Kevin: They're making fun of Cookie Monster. I get that. But in a strange way, it feels like they're making fun of me.
Kevin: [again on laptop as Cookie Monster as he shows Gabe the video] Oscar, did you eat some of my M&M's? The level...
Gabe: This is violent and offensive.
Kevin: Thank you. [computer continues] It really makes me self-conscious about my voice.
Gabe: It's awful. [reaches for tissue box, hands it to Kevin]
Kevin: I'm not crying.
Gabe: You have some food on your face.
Kevin: [on computer as Cookie Monster] Do my hands feel sweaty to you? [Kevin grabs a tissue and wipes his mouth]
Gabe: The beginning here has been a little bit of a fiasco. Either they don't respect me or they respect me too much. And some of them still think that I'm the I.T. guy. This Cookie Monster thing is an opportunity to show people that I'm an authority figure.
Gabe: Hello, everyone. If I might have a moment of your time. It's come to my attention that people have been watching and laughing at a hurtful parody video. It is now forbidden to talk, joke about, or e-mail this around.
Kevin: Yeah.
Gabe: And that's straight from corporate. So not to be scary, but yeah, I would listen to me. And that's all. Ciao.
Michael: [in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.
Erin: I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
Michael: [shakes head, annoyed] I don't know.
Erin: I would have chosen the 1490's.
Michael: Ahhh.
Erin: Cause America was discovered.
Michael: Right. [sighs]
Erin: [at lunch] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. [Michael keeps moving around, very clearly bored and annoyed]. So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?
Michael: An age or month?
Erin: Yeah, like a favorite month. Like I like April when I was seven.
Michael: I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.
Erin: How many pillows do you sleep on at night?
Michael: So how are things going with Andy?
Erin: He's the best boyfriend in the world. Tell me about him before I met him.
Michael: Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
Erin: Yeah I love that.
Michael: Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
Erin: What?
Michael: I don't think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
Erin: Sorry. About Angela? Did you say he dated Angela?
Michael: Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
Hayworth's waiter: Here we go. Hot plate.
Michael: Okay.
Hayworth's waiter: And your salad, miss.
Erin: Why wouldn't he tell me that?
Michael: I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.
Erin: They had sex?
Michael: They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?
Hayworth's waiter: Yes?
Michael: Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
Hayworth's waiter: Of course. I'll get you a bowl of pickles.
Michael: Thank you.
Erin: Uhhhh, they were engaged?
Michael: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Erin: [face looks disgusted, moves around uncomfortably] Uh-oh...
Michael: Well...
Erin: [moans, pulls hair over her face]
Michael: What are you doing? What are you doing?
Erin: In the Foster home, my hair was my room. [exhales, prolonged exclaiming]
Michael: Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
Erin: [breathes heavily, groans]
Michael: [turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!
Michael: [in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.
Pam: [feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.
Jim: What's up?
Dwight: Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.
Jim: Dwight, don't be gross.
Pam: No, no, he's right.
Dwight: Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.
Pam: That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?
Dwight: [removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.
Pam: You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?
Dwight: Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.
Pam: Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!
Meredith: I just like the way it feels.
Pam: What are you doing?!
Meredith: Just relax. Okay.
Pam: Relax?!
Meredith: This is like the Cadillac of pumps.
Pam: Give it back to me now.
Meredith: Okay, I was just warming it up.
Pam: It's disgusting!
Meredith: It's not a big deal.
Pam: It's not sterile!
Meredith: We're both girls. Who cares?
Andy: So... how was lunch?
Erin: Lunch was fine.
Andy: Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?
Erin: I don't know. It was lunch, Andy.
Andy: Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]
Oscar: Erin? I think we're out of fax cover sheets.
Erin: God, Oscar, will you keep your pants on? It's easy.
Kelly: [using a Cookie Monster voice] 'My name is Kevin, I'm an accountant.' See I did the voice.
Ryan: That's a little derivative.
Kelly: But parody is always derivative.
Ryan: Uh, it's not organic. Do you know what I mean?
Pam: Jim does a really good one. Do yours.
Jim: Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'
Gabe: Guys, why don't we leave the parodies to the pros at Mad TV?
Jim: Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'
Gabe: Ok.
Andy: Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.
Michael: You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
Andy: I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.
Michael: No. No. No.
Andy: Specific shout-out..
Michael: Stop talking.
Andy: Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..
Erin: [throws a piece of cake at Andy's face] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
Michael: Oh God.
Andy: Can we talk about this in private?
Erin: I don't want to be in private. Is it true or is it not?
Andy: Yes.
Erin: Who else did you sleep with? Did you sleep with Phyllis or Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?
Pam: No, no never.
Erin: Did everyone know? Was I the only one who didn't know?
Dwight: Yeah pretty much.
Erin: Who are you?! I don't know you! [pushes someone away to leave]
Gabe: I should probably get involved in this, but I think my energy is better spent on the Cookie Monster issue.
Kevin: Erin, you know, if I had been engaged to anyone before you, I would've told you.
Erin: Thanks.
Kevin: So if you need anything, I'm right over there.
Pam: [imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'
Gabe: Ok. Ok there. I heard that. So I'm sorry, Pam, but that's it. I'm going to have to suspend you without pay for two days.
Pam: What? What do you mean, suspend me?
Jim: I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Gabe: Yeah, you're right. You know what? Um, you're suspended too Jim. [Dwight starts to clap] Ok fine. You too Dwight.
Dwight: Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.
Gabe: I don't want to hear it. Suspended.
Kevin: C' is for suspension.
Andy: Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?
Michael: Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
Andy: I was going to tell her, just on my own time.
Michael: You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
Andy: Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.
Angela: Psst. Hey. Erin.
Erin: You want to talk to me, come to my desk.
Angela: You embarrassed me earlier.
Erin: Oh. Take it up with the chief of police.
Angela: You think I want people remembering I had sensual relations with Andy? It's the kind of thing you wish you could have annulled. I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Erin: I want to throw up just thinking about it.
Angela: You are throwing up for the wrong reasons!
Toby: [standing behind Erin] I don't think this fax is going through. Is there a different... I can just put it through again, you know.
Pam: Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.
Erin: Really?
Pam: Yeah. And he worked here too.
Erin: It was Andy, wasn't it?
Pam: No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.
Erin: I hope you find what you're looking for.
Pam: Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek]
Gabe: [talking on the phone] So I can reprimand them but I can't suspend them. Oh I can't do either. Uh huh. Fair enough.
Pam: [answers phone] Hey Toby.
Toby: I called Tallahassee. He can ask you not to come in, but he can't dock your pay. That's not legal.
Pam: Very interesting.
Toby: Yeah, I also learned some interesting things about how they structure...
Pam: [Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.
Gabe: Hey everyone. Hi. Quite an afternoon, huh? Cathartic in a way. I'm glad I got to share it with you. It makes you think about what's really important. [Pam hands Jim a note] It's not about showing you're in charge or flexing some sort of authority. It's about forgiveness. And yes, I'm talking about you three in this desk clump right here. I think that, if you were to apologize to me, then I would revoke your suspension.
Pam: I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.
Jim: And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.
Dwight: [gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.
Gabe: Great.
Dwight: [gets on one knee] I kneel before you.
Gabe: Guys, I would even take a contrite look as an apology.
Dwight: Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.
Gabe: [following Jim and Pam to their car] Guys, to err is human. [trying to block their car]
Erin: Trust is the most important thing to me. Is your name Andy Bernard? What's your real name? Lionel Frankenstein?
Andy: Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.
Erin: How long were you guys together?
Andy: A year.
Erin: A year? You were together for a year?
Andy: Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...
Erin: I think I have to be on my own for a little bit. Like the girl Precious in Precious. Based on the novel Push by Sapphire. Ok?
Andy: I didn't see that movie.
Gabe: [walking back into the office] That was ugly. I'm sorry you had to see that.
Kelly: Do they still get paid?
Gabe: It's tacky to discuss finances. It's best to pretend that this never happened.
Oscar: Sounds like they just got to go home with pay.
Meredith: Pathetic.
Gabe: Can I buy everyone coffees? [everyone shakes their heads] [in Cookie Monster voice] 'Or cookies.'
Dwight: What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?
Gabe: Alright.
Kevin: [imitating Gabe] Uh guys, I'm now going to apologize for the mess that we're in because corporate told me to. I just want you to know that I laugh like a crazy person.
Gabe: You got to be able to laugh at yourself. I'm one of the gang.
Dwight: I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.'
Kevin: Ciao' Right? 'Ciao. I say Ciao because I'm fancy from Tallahassee.'
Gabe: Why don't we say ciao to the impressions? [everyone says ciao]
Erin: [sitting on bench outside groaning]
Michael: Erin?
Erin: Oh. Sorry I thought everyone was gone.
Michael: No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
Erin: I can't trust Andy anymore.
Michael: Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
Erin: It's Andy's fault.
Michael: Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
Erin: Oh, I like his butt.
Michael: You said butt.
Erin: You tricked me!
Michael: Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'
Andy: Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.
Oscar's voice from the computer: Hey Kevin it's Oscar. I'm looking at the sheet you sent me. And I can't seem to find the column for shipping cost.
Kevin: I made the most brilliant retaliation video. It's awesome.
Phyllis: I don't get it.
Jim: Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Pam: Yeah. 'I vant to count to ten'.
Kevin: But Oscar is an accountant, and the Count counts numbers.
Kelly: But you're an accountant too.
Oscar: Why didn't you do Oscar the Grouch?
Pam: That would have been funny.
Kevin: But the Count is purple and Oscar wears purple.
Michael: [walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.
Kevin: Thank you.
Michael: Buenos dias, Erin.
Erin: Buenos dias, Miguel. [phone rings] Hello, Dunder-Mifflin.
Michael: No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
Michael: I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.
Michael: Buenos dias, Jaime.
Jim: Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?
Michael: Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
Dwight: Guten tag, Herr Michael.
Dwight: I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.
Michael: La telefona.
Oscar: El telefono.
Oscar: Michael's having a hard time with the gender part of Spanish. So I told him to mark everything with the international symbol for gender. And, um... [holds up two blurred-out drawings of male and female genitalia] I should have been more specific.
Oscar: Your office is full of genitalia.
Michael: [clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Oscar: That's what he says?'
Michael: Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.
Angela: Angela. [Michael sticks post-it on Angela's forehead with female genitalia] Michael.
Michael: Yo soy Cancun.
Angela: [removes post-it, leaves] Uhh!
Jim: All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.
Pam: You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'
Jim: Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.
Michael: Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
Dwight: You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.
Michael: I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
Dwight: If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?
Jim: [whispers] That's a good point.
Pam: This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.
Jim: Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.
Pam: We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.
Jim: [whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.
Pam: [vaudeville delivery] Yee.
Donna: Hi, uh, Donna Newton, here to see Michael Scott.
Jim: Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.
Donna: Hi!
Jim: How are you?
Michael: Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Donna: [laughing] Oh, stop that.
Michael: Hi. How are you?
Michael: There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...
Michael: Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.
Donna: You look exactly alike.
Pam: Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.
Donna: I have a sense about these things.
Jim: All right.
Donna: You have some ancestors in common... somewhere back.
Angela: I knew it. You should see their baby.
Jim: [explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.
Michael: [barges in] Hi.
Jim: Hold on one second.
Michael: Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
Jim: What?
Michael: Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Jim: None of this is time sensitive.
Michael: Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
Donna: Oh, yeah, thank you.
Michael: Okay, I have more of them.
Gabe: You would have weekly conference calls with executives in corporate. A two-week training program at the Yale school of management, obviously you would be high on the list for advancement opportunities.
Darryl: Sounds all right.
Dwight: What is this?
Gabe: Oh, this is 'Print in All Colors,' Sabre's minority executive training program.
Dwight: It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.
Darryl: I didn't say 'a'ight.'
Dwight: How do I apply?
Gabe: You have to be a minority.
Dwight: Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?
Gabe: Those don't really count. We're thinking more ethnic and racial minorities.
Dwight: Come here. Come here.
Gabe: Hmm?
Dwight: Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?
Gabe: Well...
Darryl: I like the sound of this. [looks at Dwight] Maybe one day I'll be sitting in Michael's chair. Wouldn't that be something?
Dwight: One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?
Kelly: [on phone] This is the second time that you've sent me the wrong size. I mean, I know what a four feels like. I've been a four my whole life. You know what? You can go to Hell. All right? Thanks for nothing.
Dwight: Oh, man. White people, right?
Kelly: I don't know if she was white.
Dwight: Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.
Kelly: Yeah.
Dwight: I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.
Kelly: Well, they say it's because of texting, but maybe you're right.
Dwight: I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.
Kelly: Never thought of myself as an executive before.
Dwight: I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?
Kelly: I can't think of any CEO's, any race.
Dwight: You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.
Kelly: I could be the Indian Julia Roberts.
Dwight: That's not... she's... okay. Yes.
Michael: I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.
Donna: Mm-hmm.
Michael: And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.
Donna: Yeah.
Michael: It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.
Michael: This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.
Donna: Who took the photo?
Michael: Ryan.
Donna: Oh. [Michael quickly advances PowerPoint show to last slide which is 'SEX' in bold white letters on a black background and then exits the show quickly]
Michael: And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
Donna: [giggles] Not bad.
Michael: Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.
Donna: Thank you. [Michael tries t kiss Donna, Donna clears throat] Hmm.
Michael: Hmm.
Donna: Oh my God. [realizing Jim and Pam are looking through the conference room windows]
Michael: Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
Michael: [in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?
Jim: No.
Pam: I'll have one.
Jim: Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.
Michael: Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
Jim: Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.
Pam: Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.
Donna: Was it professional? No. But I work in the nightlife industry. I get hit on all the time. In my 20's it would have been annoying. In my late 20's, I find it really flattering.
Michael: Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.
Pam: What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?
Jim: What?
Jim: What was that?
Pam: Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.
Jim: Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.
Pam: Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.
Jim: Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.
Pam: Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]
Dwight: How as being a minority affected you?
Kelly: Well, there's a lot of pressure from my parents to settle down and marry an Indian guy.
Dwight: Oh, good, and you resent this because...
Kelly: Indian guys always wear their cell phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.
Dwight: Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.
Kelly: Just put it in your pocket.
Michael and Donna: [indistinct chatter inside conference room]
Kevin: [looking it] Look at that. She's totally flirting with him.
Phyllis: You don't know that. Some people can't help oozing sexuality.
Creed: You ever notice you can ooze two things: sexuality and pus. Man, I tell ya.
Phyllis: She just crossed her arms together... that's bad.
Pam: Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.
Kevin: [tries it by crossing his arms] Like that? [to Andy]
Donna: Is this... is this the best you can do right there?
Jim: Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.
Donna: Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used to the restaurant business, [removes sweater revealing her revealing top] where, if you're in charge, then you can always get discounts for the people that you like.
Jim: Yeah. [chuckles]
Michael: So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
Jim: What's that?
Michael: Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
Jim: I don't... I don't think so.
Michael: I think we could. [Donna giggles]
Oscar: I don't see how we could possibly sell these for that little without losing money. Delivery alone will cost...
Michael: Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
Oscar: Actually, ran the numbers on this, and in this case, it makes more financial sense to gain money.
Michael: Why don't you run them again?
Jim: What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Michael: If she is, it's working.
Kevin: Yeah, Michael, here's a trick. Ask her if she wants a mint. If she says 'no,' then she is not interested.
Jim: She does not like him.
Pam: You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?
Jim: cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
Pam: I was after your money.
Jim: Well, the joke was on you.
Pam: Yes, it was.
Kelly: [typing] Can you stop micromanaging? I know how to do this.
Ryan: Okay...
Dwight: Hey... what are you guys doing?
Kelly: This girl was really rude to me at the mall. So I created a fake I.M. account from a hot guy at her high school, and now I'm trying to make her anorexic.
Ryan: Tell her everyone in home room thinks she's fat.
Kelly: Oh, that is so good.
Dwight: You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.
Kelly: Oh, that's okay. Ryan coached me.
Dwight: Ryan? What does he know?
Ryan: It's easy... you just turn every question around on them. Do you think you're treated differently because of your race?
Kelly: Would you ask that same question if I was white? We're so in.
Dwight: We?'
Kelly: When I become executive, I'm gonna make Ryan manager.
Ryan: And then the two of us are cleanin' house.
Dwight: Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.
Michael: So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...
Donna: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?
Donna: Yes.
Michael: I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
Donna: Oh, I haven't tried those. No.
Michael: They're good [Donna grabs mint]
Donna: You want one?
Michael: Sure.
Donna: It's like cool... 'certified cool.' I like how they say 'certified.' Like there's some consortium of... [Michael grabs the mint from Donna's hand with his mouth, Donna pulls her hand away] Michael!
Michael: I can't stop myself from kissing her.
Kevin: Yeah, now you know how I feel sitting next to those M&M's all day.
Andy: Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?
Kevin: Well, why don't you shut up!
Michael: Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
Jim: It is totally insane.
Oscar: Michael, he's right. You are turning into a stalker.
Michael: Okay. What do you think?
Kevin: I think it's over, man.
Michael: Andy?
Andy: Ehh.
Michael: Okay, some for, some against.
Jim: Nobody's for.
Michael: Pam?
Pam: Hmm?
Mihael: What do you think?
Pam: Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.
Jim: What?
Pam: I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.
Michael: I'm going with Pam's group.
Jim: Wait.
Michael: Here we go.
Jim: Michael. Michael.
Michael: Okay.
Jim: Michael.
Michael: No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
Jim: No.
Michael: What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.
Dwight: Kelly is disqualified!
Gabe: What?
Dwight: You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.
Gabe: Yeah, but she's not white, though.
Dwight: Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.
Gabe: Darryl withdrew his application. He said the Yale program interfered with his softball league, you know? He's gone.
Darryl: I got my whole life to be a minority executive. I only have about a year left in these knees, though.
Dwight: Kelly is the only applicant.
Gabe: Yeah, unless somebody else applies today.
Kelly: Namaste.
Dwight: Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.
Kelly: Hello.
Gabe: That's very nice. [referring to Kelly's bindi] I never noticed that before.
Kelly: Sometimes my bangs cover it.
Gabe: Yeah. I don't want to be offensive but, uh... may I ask you what that means?
Kelly: I do find that offensive, actually.
Michael: We should have your contract done by Thursday.
Donna: Oh, great. Great, I will look out for that stuff, then.
Michael: Okay.
Donna: And, um... you know I just wanted to say it was really... really nice to do business with you.
Michael: Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
Donna: Thank you. Did I... get everything?
Michael: I don't know. I think so.
Donna: Yeah, I think so.
Michael: [whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
Donna: Yeah? Do you need validation? We don't... we don't validate.
Donna: No, it's just in the lot, so...
Michael: Thank you so much.
Donna: You're welcome. [they hug] You're... welcome.
Michael: Mmm. [Donna giggles]
Donna: Bye.
Michael: [follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
Donna: I don't have, uh, any other questions. [blind clanking as she leans against door to prevent from Michael kissing her] I'm just gonna... make my way down to...
Michael: All right. All right. Bye.
Donna: Bye-bye!
Michael: And have a good elevator ride.
Donna: Okay.
Michael: Oh, what's that out there?
Kevin: Michael, how did it go? [Michael goes in his office and closes door]
Dwight: How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?
Erin: Holy cow. I'd be so happy.
Dwight: I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.
Erin: I know. I meant I'd be happy for them.
Dwight: What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.
Stanley: Dwight, I know these programs. 'Every color is important because, together, we make a rainbow.'
Dwight: Yes.
Stanley: I'll slap you in the face with a rainbow.
Erin: Mm!
Dwight: Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.
Oscar: Dwight, we know Kelly applied. We're not gonna cross her. No matter how good the program is.
Dwight: I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen]
Kelly: For hobbies, um, yoga, belly dancing, snake charming. Beds of nails. I like lying on them.
Dwight: Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.
Kelly: Dwight: What are you doing?
Dwight: Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.
Kelly: God, I hate you so much! [gets up, leaves]
Dwight: Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.
Hide: Why? I don't need translator.
Dwight: You don't know what you need. Just...
Gabe: Well, uh... why don't you just tell me a little about yourself, Hide.
Hide: In Japan, heart surgeon, number one. Steady hand.
Pam: Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?
Michael: I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
Pam: You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.
Michael: She suckered you too.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Was it the cleavage?
Pam: Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.
Michael: Yep.
Phyllis: Michael, you know, it's easy to get fooled. Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me all the time. It... it's mostly harmless. Usually I don't let it go too far.
Andy: You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.
Erin: Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?
Michael: God. She left this here?
Erin: Yeah.
Michael: Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
Jim: What?
All: No.
Michael: Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
Oscar: It's not a signal. It's just a coincidence. No, it's not even a coincidence. It's just something that happened.
Pam: Michael...
Michael: [hold up barrette] Well...
Pam: She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.
Michael: Yeah, I know. I know.
Pam: I'm sorry.
Michael: I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]
Pam: Michael! [sighs]
Michael: [runs down to parking lot, sighs]
Donna: [still in parking lot sitting in her car] Michael!
Michael: Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
Gabe: Everyone, it is my pleasure to announce our newest member of the Sabre minority executive training program. Kelly Rajnigandha Kapoor. [clapping] All right.
Gabe: They're going to be pretty pleased in Tallahassee that I snagged an Indian for the program. She'll be the first. The program's mostly black. It's almost too black. That didn't sound right.
Kelly: [puts a bindi on Erin's forehead] And the best part is is that I get a business stipend to buy all new clothes. So you can totally buy any of my old clothes that I'm not gonna need anymore.
Erin: Oh, my God, thank you so much. I love that denim jumpsuit you have. How much?
Kelly: Oh. Actually I was thinking about clothes that I was just gonna give to Goodwill anyway.
Erin: Great.
Dwight: Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]
Kelly: Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: Oh.
Kelly: I'll never forget everything that you've done for me.
Dwight: Gosh. He he.
Kelly: Because I never forget anything.
Dwight: Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?
Michael: You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.
Donna: No, y-you were... right.
Michael: Who?
Donna: You were right.
Michael: About what?
Donna: You were right. [Michael leans into Donna's car to kiss her and they kiss passionately] I'm sorry.
Michael: No, no. No.
Donna: I'm sor...
Michael: No... [they kiss again]
Michael: [returns to office] What happened?
Erin: Kelly got into the minority training program.
Michael: Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.
Kevin: Ooh.
Phyllis: Oh, Michael.
Michael: No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
Michael: You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!
Dwight: Stop it!
Jim: Stop what?
Dwight: You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!
Jim: [chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
Jim: Yup. That's exactly what we did.
Pam: It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'
Dwight: Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!
Michael: Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?
Jim: It's a pen.
Dwight: Michael, come on.
Michael: Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
Dwight: Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically]
Michael: Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!
Michael: Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.
Stanley: I have an idea for your weekend.
Michael: Okay.
Stanley: Let me get back to my desk right now.
Michael: Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
Pam: Stanley got to go.
Michael: Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
Andy: Walk around apple orchards.
Michael: Oh!
Andy: Super romantic.
Michael: That's fun.
Dwight: Eel fishing.
Michael: All right.
Darryl: Curl up with your favorite DVD.
Meredith: You and Donna should hit the Poconos. They have heart-shaped Jacuzzis. Room enough for three.
Michael: We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
Kelly: Wait, why would you go all the way to the Poconos to P.F. Chang's when we have the Great Wall in Scranton.
Michael: Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
Kelly: Wait, that's crazy far. Are you sure she's not cheating?
Michael: You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
Ryan: Some diner?! It was the Starlight Diner! It's in a LIFE magazine spread about Americana.
Michael: You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
Pam: No, Michael, no.
Dwight: Are you nuts?
Pam: You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...
Michael: ... and... we had sex, too.
Pam: That is right. Don't make any more of it.
Michael: How?
Pam: How what?
Michael: How do I not make any more of it?
Pam: You could start by concluding this meeting.
Michael: All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'
Dwight: Oh, no.
Andy: How many dates have you been on?
Michael: Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
Andy: Mm.
Oscar: That seems... quick. Even for lesbians.
Ryan: Does she keep her phone locked around you, Michael? Does she watch how much she drinks around you, Michael?
Ryan: Does she leave the room when she takes phone calls? Does she keep perfume in her purse? Does she shower before sex? Does she shower after sex? Does she...
Michael: Yeah, she does all that.
Ryan: Sorry, dude.
Michael: No, no...
Pam: Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.
Michael: Run what?
Pam: Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.
Michael: Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
Pam: Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.
Michael: Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
Jim: You do?
Michael: Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
Jim: But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.
Michael: That's what makes it so wrong.
Michael: Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.
Dwight: Oh, God, that tickles. What did...
Michael: [whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
Dwight: I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card]
Michael: This is you. How much do you charge?
Dwight: $100 a day, plus expenses.
Michael: I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
Dwight: I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]
Andy: Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.
Stanley: My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs. We all got problems.
Andy: Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.
Gabe: There's no way that you guys have any almond butter, right?
Andy: Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.
Gabe: That's weird. I haven't heard of that happening. I would even settle for apricot preserves.
Andy: What are we gonna do about this?
Gabe: I don't know. Call HQ, see if they know anything. Yeah. That's what I'll do today. All right. Yeah.
Andy: Let me know what they say.
Darryl: [puts newspaper down] Wow. That dude is good.
Andy: What do you mean?
Darryl: You didn't feel like he was hiding something?
Andy: I don't know.
Darryl: Like he was... covering something up? Maybe.
Darryl: Two years ago, Andy blamed the warehouse for a late shipment that he forgot to process. We got yelled at pretty bad. Almost lost my job, and I was mad as hell at the time. But I said 'Darryl, just wait. He's a fool. There's gonna be an opportunity. Just be patient.' [smiles]
Dwight: [sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.
Donna: Oh, hi. You work for Michael.
Dwight: I work with Michael.
Donna: Right.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands]
Donna: Donna, hi.
Dwight: All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.
Jim: That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?
Michael: It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
Pam: Oh!...
Jim: Oh, my God
Michael: It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.
Jim: You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.
Michael: I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
Pam: Why do we have to see what Dwight says?
Michael: Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
Jim: Michael, no...
Pam: No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.
Michael: It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
Pam: Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.
Michael: God, this is so disgusting.
Pam: Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.
Michael: I know.
Pam: And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.
Michael: That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
Pam: Helene.
Michael: Helene?
Pam: My mother.
Michael: Oh.
Pam: My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]
Michael: Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
Jim: You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.
Michael: [sighs] All right. [calls Dwight]
Dwight: [at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.
Donna: Thank you.
Dwight: It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]
Donna: You okay?
Dwight: Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?
Donna: [chuckles] Yeah, I think I know what you're talking about.
Dwight: Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.
Dwight: [moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?
Donna: Nope. I'm good, thanks.
Dwight: Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']
Old lady: Look, young man, can you wipe down that seat?
Dwight: Get out of my way. Huh!
Dwight: Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?
Donna: I'm out of here.
Dwight: Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.
Donna: You stay away from me, or I'm calling security.
Dwight: Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]
Michael: You're back. What happened?
Dwight: Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
Michael: No, what happened with Donna?
Dwight: Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]
Michael: Ugh!
Dwight: Put your fingers here.
Michael: No. No! Are you sure?
Dwight: I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.
Michael: Who eats eight protein bars?
Dwight: People who don't trust egg whites.
Michael: Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
Dwight: Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.
Michael: What? No, she didn't say that.
Dwight: You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.
Michael: I am not paying for that membership.
Michael: [sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...
Erin: Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own office.
Michael: No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
Erin: Uh, no. [Michael sighs, Donna enters] Wait, yes.
Michael: That's her?
Erin: Yeah.
Michael: Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.
Donna: How could you think I would cheat on you?
Michael: I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Donna: That's pathetic.
Michael: Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
Donna: When I tell you I like you, you need to trust me, not some freak. [Dwight is gulping some sort of power shake]
Michael: If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
Donna: I told you I like you.
Michael: Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]
Donna: Hey, if I said that we should go away for a couple of days, you would...
Michael: ...poop my pants.
Donna: Have you ever been to Vero Beach?
Michael: Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
Donna: We're going.
Michael: We are?
Donna: Yeah.
Andy: What's up? I got your e-mail.
Darryl: Close the door.
Andy: Okay.
Darryl: I don't have a plan exactly. More of a loose structure. Gives me freedom to improvise. It's like jazz. [scatting] Andy don't mess with me. [continues scatting] I'll figure something out.
Darryl: Some freaky stuff going on. I was walking behind Gabe and I heard some things.
Andy: Such as?
Darryl: It was kind of mumbled, I don't know, uh, only thing I could make out clearly was 'Andy,' 'Problem,' 'Eliminate,' something. I don't know what it meant.
Andy: What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?'
Darryl: Whoa. I hadn't even thought of that.
Andy: [chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.
Kelly: Oh, hey, I love your earrings.
Donna: Thank you.
Kelly: Did Michael get them for you?
Donna: No, I bought them myself.
Kelly: Where?
Donna: Steamtown Mall.
Kelly: Claire's? Zales? Ricky's? Earring, Earrings? Fancy Girl? Platinum Cat? Where?
Donna: You know, I actually got them in Philadelphia, in a mall down there.
Kelly: Franklin Mills? King of Prussia? Springfield? Governor's Place?
Donna: Uh, Franklin Mills.
Jim: [to Pam] What?
Pam: Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.
Pam: Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.
Jim: Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?
Pam: No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.
Creed: Psst... [Creed walks by Andy and draws his right index finger across his neck, further scaring Andy, Andy looks over at Darryl who is staring him down]
Andy: Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.
Creed: So there I am, minding my own business and Darnell offers me three bucks. All I gotta do is walk by Andy and go like this. [draws finger across neck] Darnell's a chump. I would have done it for anything. I've done a lot more for a lot less.
Pam: So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.
Donna: Isn't that something?
Michael: Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.
Pam: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Hey.
Pam: I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.
Michael: Well it can wait. It can wait.
Pam: I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.
Michael: Jim is her husband.
Donna: Oh.
Pam: And...
Michael: And they are having problems, so sh...
Pam: No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...
Michael: Good in bed.
Pam: Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.
Michael: Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
Pam: [loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!
Michael: Okay, weirdo.
Pam: I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out]
Donna: Yeah I think it'll be a nice trip. We're gonna get a lot done.
Pam: [to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?
Donna: I am, but I, I gave my clubs away. I swear too much. [Pam and Donna both laugh] Hey, you okay? [to Michael, walking away disappointedly]
Michael: Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Pam: Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office]
Darryl: Look, I'm not down there anymore, so if the guys start making fun of you, you just, you gotta stand up for yourself.
Glen: I know, it's just, I'm scared...
Andy: Your text said 911.
Darryl: Glen, could you excuse us? [Andy slams the door after Glen leaves, panting heavily]
Darryl: It's bad.
Andy: What's bad?
Darryl: It's real bad.
Darryl: Still no plan.
Andy: Oh, God.
Darryl: It's getting bigger.
Andy: I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.
Darryl: I can videotape it.
Andy: Yeah.
Darryl: [to camera] There it is.
Andy: There what is?
Darryl: What?
Michael: Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?
Pam: I don't know who he is.
Michael: God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
Pam: What?
Michael: I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
Pam: You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.
Michael: I have to hear it from her.
Pam: You have to settle down first.
Michael: I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
Pam: Okay. Okay. Yes.
Michael: I need to have her say...
Pam: Yeah, but you have to calm...
Michael: I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'
Pam: Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.
Michael: No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
Pam: [in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael
Michael: [calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.
Gabe: [to Andy] I talked to corporate. Turns out there have been 12 reports of faulty printers. Out of 400,000. [smiles] We've investigated. Every time it's been user error.  They block the vents or something, I don't know. That's why we have the fine print. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. So I'd like to reward you for that. [pulls out gift card] That's god for five bucks at Dunkin' Donuts. Any Dunkin' Donuts. [Andy looks over at Darryl and Darryl motions for Andy to go to him]
Michael: You know what? We should really do something fun this week.
Donna: Yeah, we should.
Michael: Wouldn't that be fun?
Donna: Yeah.
Michael: How about Thursday?
Donna: Thursday works. Yeah, what do you wanna do?
Michael: I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
Donna: Oh, Friday doesn't work.
Michael: Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
Donna: Shoot. I'm working.
Michael: Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
Donna: Well, won't you be at the concert?
Michael: Nope, that's Tuesday.
Donna: Oh, well, I can make it on Tuesday.
Michael: You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
Donna: How do you know?
Michael: Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]
Pam: [gasps] Did she see me?
Jim: [to Pam on floor] Nice effort.
Andy: [in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]
Darryl: You haven't even introduced yourself.
Andy: Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.
Darryl: You should talk in a higher voice 'cause the camera makes you sound weird.
Andy: Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...
Darryl: Higher. [motions with hand to go up more]
Andy: Make it higher? Okay.
Darryl: Mm-hmm
Andy: [high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...
Darryl: One more, yeah. [Again motions to go even higher]
Andy: [higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!
Darryl: This... [removes camera headset]
Andy: We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.
Darryl: I don't wanna prank anymore. Things get real. It's not funny. I'm just gonna be good, stay in my room, go to church, try to do one nice thing per day. I do not wanna prank anymore.
Michael: Who is he?
Donna: What, what do you mean?
Michael: The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
Donna: It's you. I'm married.
Michael: I'm the mistress?
Dwight: [on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.
Gym Instructor: Excuse me. Yeah, I'd appreciate it if you'd just let me run this.
Dwight: You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!
Gym instructor: Don't listen to him, we're approaching a cooldown down a gentle hill.
Dwight: No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.
Gym instructor: No, guys, no. We're just cooling down...
Dwight: If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.
Toby: This here is a radon test kit. [holding out tiny cylinder disc] Okay I will be putting 'em everywhere. And... please don't throw these out. [starts snapping towards Michael's face] This is a radon test kit. [continues snapping] Please don't throw these out. [Michael gives annoyed look] See them all over the office.
Michael: Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite. [takes radon kit from the top of the blinds of his office window and slams it into the trash can]
Michael: Pfffffttt.
Toby: Come on, Michael. You're interrupting.
Michael: You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
Toby: Please sit down.
Michael: You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
Everyone: YEAH! [laughter]
Michael: Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
Everyone: No. No!
Jim: That's... not okay.
Michael: Okay, alright.
Dwight: You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Michael: I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Dwight: No, hmmm... that's still...
Everyone: Mm-mm.
Michael: Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
Creed: Curve the bullet. Like in my favorite James McAvoy film, Wanted.
Oscar: All that does is help you shoot around things. What does Bin Laden...
Ryan: Is there a curtain rod in the room?
Michael: I don't know.
Stanley: How about make-believe land has anything you want?
Jim: Stanley, please, this is serious!
Angela: Is this the thing where they use an icicle so there's no evidence?
Michael: Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
Dwight: Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this. [stands up and points to Phyllis] Phyllis, you're Hitler. Come up here. Toby, you're Toby. Andy, you're Bin Laden. Line up, throats together.
Toby: I don't wanna do this.
Michael: [shouting] Toby, just do it! God!
Dwight: Toby, come on. [Andy lines up to the right of Toby and Phyllis is on his left]
Dwight: Ready, one bullet. And boom! [makes shooting noises and mimics a bullet with his fingers tapping Phyllis' throat, then Toby's, and finally Andy's]
Everyone: Yeah, that works. That works!
Michael: Good work. [clapping]
Pam: What flavors did you get? [yawns]
Erin: It's so exciting Pam. The Eagles are doing a theme of ice creams in honor of turning 60.
Pam: [reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?
Erin: Do you want me to go back to the store?
Pam: No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.
Erin: This is all for Michael. It turns out his girlfriend was married.
Pam: Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.
Erin: After his last breakup, he ate 40,000 calories in three hours. Right, Pam? That's what Pam told me.
Pam: [yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.
Erin: That's okay. You probably shouldn't keep a baby up that late, though.
Erin: We have Mr. Bean playing in the conference room and the Pink Panther movie in his office. With half hour shifts to watch it with him.
Pam: And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.
Erin: He's coming.
Pam: Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.
Toby: [walks in] Hey everyone.
Pam: No, out! Get out now! Leave now.
Dwight: Leave, get outta here.
Pam: Leave!
Dwight: Right now!
Pam: Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?
Michael: [walks in] Morning everyone.
Everyone: Hey! [applauses] Hey, hey!
Erin: Hi Michael. [gives him a hug]
Michael: Hello!
Dwight: Michael, nice tie or something.
Michael: Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]
Kevin: That's hilarious.
Pam: That's awesome. You want some ice cream?
Michael: Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Kevin: Boi-oi-oi-ing
Michael: Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
Lawyer: I don't follow this exactly. Uh, 'The Descendants of any replicants from this union shall have...'
Dwight and Angela: Joint custody
Lawyer: Are we talking about your grandchildren?
Angela: No.
Dwight: No.
Angela: Rather than spend all day in court, we've decided to settle our dispute using a mediator. It was an option spelled out in our childrearing contract.
Dwight: Alleged contract.
Angela: Alleged? I'm going to own your farm by the time this is over.
Dwight: Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
Dwight: So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?
Angela: I'm doing it. You know I am. It's disgusting.
Dwight: How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
Angela: Dwight, look at my teeth. [shows teeth, beet red]
Dwight: Eughh. [looks disgusted]
Andy: No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.
Pam: Could he still be seeing her?
Phyllis: I don't think he'd do that.
Jim: So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Andy: Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.
Jim: Exactly. It happened in Big.
Michael: No, I gotta go. Text me later.
Jim: I'm really too tired to do this.
Pam: Me too!
Jim: Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
Pam: Hey Michael.
Michael: Hey.
Pam: We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.
Jim: We can order in from Hooters.
Michael: Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
Pam: We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.
Jim: Billy Joel Rock Band.
Michael: That... exists?
Pam: Yes.
Michael: Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
Pam: [shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?
Michael: Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Phyllis: Oh Michael.
Michael: Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
Michael: I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.
Meredith: That is something I would never do.
Michael: Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
Meredith: Hey, I have never cheated on, been cheated on, or been used to cheat with.
Meredith: I ask... everyone in the room, 'Are you in a relationship?'.
Michael: People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.
Kelly: Eughh, Ryan, I do not want you hanging around Michael anymore.
Ryan: Okay.
Michael: I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
Andy: How does he feel about it?
Michael: He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
Jim: Now you're just being hurtful.
Michael: I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
Phyllis: Hey!
Michael: On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
Andy: Did Donna tell you that?
Michael: Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
Andy: So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.
Michael: You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Andy: My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.
Andy: So... here's the thing about infidelity.
Michael: Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
Andy: How does that work?
Michael: Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
Andy: In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.
Michael: I am Beyonce always.
Andy: Not this time.
Michael: Yes, I am.
Andy: This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.
Michael: I would love that.
Andy: Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.
Michael: I have work to do.
Andy: Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.
Michael: Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
Andy: [humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum
Michael: All right, Andy, please.
Andy: Baseball!
Michael: Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
Andy: Where?
Michael: Right there. The coach!
Andy: Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!
Michael: Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
Andy: [announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.
Michael: All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
Andy: Whatever. I'm the one blending in.
Gabe: [ahem][Pam snores] Guys?
Jim: Pam.
Pam: Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.
Gabe: Can you two please join me in my office? Now.
Pam: You were supposed to be the Lookout.
Jim: Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Gabe: I don't wanna be the heavy here, but honestly, guys, this makes us all look bad.
Jim: Sorry about that.
Pam: So embarrassing.
Gabe: Good. Okay. End of the dressing down. I just hate that part of the job, you know, the power dynamics.
Jim: Well, you were surprisingly restrained.
Pam: We will be well-rested tomorrow.
Gabe: Okay. That's great, actually, because I wanted to talk to you about something else.
Jim: Excellent. Go for it.
Gabe: I'm sure you got my email about the printer fires. The one with the branching decision tree? I actually designed that chart. Kinda hoping it catches on. [Jim and Pam struggling to stay awake] Anyway, the question is, what is the best way to disseminate important information in an efficient way?
Jim: Right? So, uh, let's uh...
Lawyer: Finally there's a provision here in the occurrence that the child is born an old man, a la Benjamin Button.
Angela: Same page. Go to the next one.
Dwight: Same page. Just keep moving.
Lawyer: Despite the provision covering whether this is all part of the matrix--
Dwight: Which we can't know.
Lawyer: This is essentially...
Dwight: Unless we're unplugged.
Lawyer: Equivalent to a donor or surrogate contractor.
Dwight: And wake up in the future.
Lawyer: Which is actually pretty common. So I have to tell you that this is a solid contract.
Dwight: What?
Lawyer: Look, I can't enforce that anybody have a child with anyone else.
Angela: What?
Lawyer: So essentially, this comes down to damages. Now, there is some precedence for the range of $30,000.
Dwight: What?
Dwight: I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.
Andy: Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.
Michael: You have no idea what you're talking about.
Andy: I know it's like cricket.
Michael: You don't. No, no.
Andy: And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.
Michael: You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'
Andy: Seems pretty well liked by the team.
Michael: Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
Andy: You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.
Michael: I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
Dwight: $30,000? There's gotta be another way.
Angela: He has a 60-acre beet farm that is worth a small fortune.
Dwight: Look, I will not pay.
Angela: Well, I have an alternative.[hands Dwight a document]
Dwight: Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?'
Lawyer: Look, I don't think that's actually legal.
Dwight: Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela]
Dwight: Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.
Dwight: But not in your bed. It's lumpy.
Angela: Those lumps are cats, and those cats have names, and those names are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, and Lumpy.
Dwight: Fine. Five times. [signs contract]
Lawyer: Look, I can't legally watch this unfold. It's coming a little dangerously close to prostitution.
Angela: I want eye contact.
Dwight: No.
Angela: Yes.
Dwight: Do you understand how rare is that in nature?
Angela: I'm not some farm animal. [Dwight smirks at the camera]
Andy: Great game, coach.
Michael: Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
Andy: You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.
Shane: Yeah, right. You must be rootin' for the other guys.
Andy: Ha. The other guys can go die.
Michael: [whispers] Okay.
Andy: Baseball! Go talk to him.
Michael: No. God. You go talk to him.
Shane: Let's go.
Andy: Shane. Great game man!
Shane: Do I know you?
Andy: No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.
Shane: Are you somebody's... parents? Oh, are you guys... Kenny's dads?
Andy: Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles]
Shane: Okay.
Andy: But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.
Shane: Okay. Let's go!
Andy: Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.
Shane: Whoa!
Andy: I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.
Shane: Hey, I'm really sorry, I'm just trying to... focus here on the game.
Andy: I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.
Shane: Of course. Okay? I gotta... get back to this.
Andy: Of course.
Shane: All right.
Andy: But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!
Michael: No, no, no.
Andy: Come on, get over here.
Michael: I'm good. Oh, my God.
Andy: Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.
Michael: Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
Shane: It's all right. It's all right. Keep it going.
Michael: Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
Michael: Okay, orange slices. There ya go.
Erin: Thanks, Michael.
Michael: Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
Oscar: Why would you throw something wet at me?
Michael: You love it. There ya go.
Jim: Now, were those for the team?
Michael: Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
Jim: Ah.
Pam: I don't think those were yours to take.
Michael: Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
Andy: I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.
Pam: Did you talk to him?
Michael: I did.
Pam: You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.
Kevin: Wow. That is crazy.
Phyllis: Was there a fistfight?
Michael: No. We just talked. He's very nice.
Phyllis: And it didn't change your mind.
Michael: It did not.
Phyllis: Michael, that's awful.
Michael: Isn't it?
Phyllis: Yes.
Michael: I'm awful, aren't I?
Kevin: Yeah. That's pretty bad.
Michael: I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
Oscar: How can you live with yourself?
Michael: I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
Kevin: That is a dangerous game, friendo.
Kelly: Well, because I thought that it was a book about Anthropology the store.
Ryan: I don't know why you were in that part of the bookstore.
Kelly: Cause it's next to they baby section, okay?
Ryan: All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, 'I read a book about anthropology.'
Kelly: I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now.
Ryan: I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming.
Kelly: That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.
Michael: I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
Ryan: Good for you, man. Good for you.
Ryan: He takes what he wants.
Ryan: You know what? I think you're attractive, and I wanna sleep with you.
Erin: What about Kelly?
Ryan: You read my mind.
Erin: [quietly] Is this a joke?
Ryan: Yep.
Ryan: It's hard to live that way man. You gotta really not care what people think about you. I-I don't know how you do it, Michael, I-I-I can't be that cold.
Michael: You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
Dwight: [pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!
Creed: [Michael leaving copy machine] Uh, boss, we're out of paper.
Michael: Yeah, I noticed that.
Creed: Are you gonna add any more?
Michael: Nope.
Creed: He don't give an 'F' about nothin'!
Michael: I have got big balls.
Pam: I don't think I'm gonna make it.
Jim: [yawning] What about an energy drink or something?
Pam: [shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.
Jim: Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
Pam: Well, it does and it doesn't.
Darryl: Probably shouldn't tell you this, but a lotta guys in the warehouse work multiple jobs, so... we have a place.
Jim: A place?
Darryl: A restful location. Talk to Glen. He'll take you up in the lift.
Pam: You sleep in the warehouse?
Darryl: Lightbulb's burnt out, so it's dark. And the heat from the backup generator keeps it nice and warm. Sometimes I think about it when I'm trying to fall asleep at home. But as far as the rest of the office goes, it doesn't exist, okay?
Jim: Okay.
Darryl: Pam.
Pam: Okay.
Phyllis: For your signature. [drops document on Michael's desk]
Michael: Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
Kevin: Why not your condo?
Michael: Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
Stanley: Oh, Michael, will you drop it? Everybody's spoken their mind, and no one's changing their mind.
Michael: Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Andy: Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.
Michael: Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes]
Dwight: I could have stopped him.
Dwight: Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse]
Angela: No.
Dwight: God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]
Angela: What did you do to yourself? [camera pans to Jim and Pam laying down in restful location]
Dwight: Never mind. Just never mind.
Angela: Well, it better work.
Dwight: Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
Michael: [driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.
Reporter: Michael Scott?
Michael: Yes?
Reporter: Do you wanna make a comment on the rumors?
Michael: [sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
Reporter: I'm talking about the Sabre printers that catch on fire.
Michael: Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
Michael: [on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.
Todd Packer: [high-pitched voice] I saw you on the news and I want to pinch your tiny wiener...  [normal voice] It's Packer!
Michael: OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Michael: Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.
Michael: Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.
Oscar: What's number one?
Michael: Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
Jim: So instead of working, you want...
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
Angela: Oh, did you see this report that the zoo got a baby otter? It's on the same site!
Phyllis: Awww, it's kissing its mommy!
Michael: Please.
Dwight: Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.
Michael: Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.
Jo: Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Michael: Jo! We were not expecting you!
Jo: Course you all, no doubt, know why I'm here.
Kevin: No.
Jo: Turns out our printers are famous. They're all over the news. It's an interesting story. Cheap foreign printers attacking innocent Americans. Well, actually the, the real story isn't quite as racy, but uh... let's give it a go.
Kevin: Jo, I think that I know what happened.
Jo: I'm not sure you do, teddy bear.
Kevin: Well, now I think I might not.
Jo: Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.
Michael: Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
Jo: Can you now?
Michael: Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
Phyllis: [quietly, to Andy] Put your hand up, Norma Rae.
Andy: If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.
Andy: So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?
Jo: [as Gabe hands out forms to everyone] It's a little form, says 'I did not do it.'
Michael: There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
Jo: All that's just birthday information, Michael.
Michael: Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
Jo: Why don't you come with me? We'll start out with the honcho, what'cha say?
Michael: Okay.
Jo: When Mama was working as a prison guard and something went missing, she'd ask one question: What do we do when we find the guilty party? And if they said, 'Come down on him with that swift hammer of justice!', innocent. A clear conscience don't need no mercy. But if they said 'Officer Bessie, well they may have had a reason, blah blah blah blah', well nine times out of ten, that's the anus they'd check.
Jo: So say we catch this whistleblower, what do you think I should do with him?
Michael: We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
Jo: Uh, that's, uh, Guantanamo Bay.
Michael: Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
Jo: Well, I guess we're all right, Michael.
Michael: I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
Jo: Yeah.
Michael: Okay.
Nick: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: Hey, IT guy.
Nick: Mind if I get in there for a second?
Dwight: Oh, sure thing, go ahead.
Nick: Just one... [Dwight pushes Nick's neck to the desk and pushes his arm up] Gah! Ah! Dwight, what the hell?
Dwight: Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
Oscar: The lawyers are searching our hard drives for information on the leak. Thanks a lot, Big Brother.
Dwight: You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Kevin: Wait, are they searching all our computers?
Nick: Yeah. [Kevin runs to his desk] I already got to yours, Kevin. [Kevin runs back]
Kevin: No, that's cool. Sometimes... sometimes I run. I'm a runner.
Angela: Everybody knows it was Andy, and it is not fair for us all to take the fall for his big stupid mouth!
Michael: Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
Phyllis: Look, he's been complaining about this for a while, it's not crazy.
Jo: Okay Dwight.
Dwight: Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.
Jo: Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
Dwight: Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?
Jo: Yeah, I noticed you've had a great year. Good boy... you turning that money into more money?
Dwight: Are you referring to alchemy?
Jo: I don't like to tell a man what to do with his money, but if you ain't investing in property, then you're dumber than a dummy.
Dwight: I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
Jo: Well, buy property. That's my advice.
Michael: Is there something that you would like to say to me?
Andy: Uh...
Michael: About talking to the press?
Andy: I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!
Michael: Mmhmm.
Andy: Okay? I, I... didn't do it.
Michael: I don't believe you.
Andy: I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.
Michael: That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
Andy: I don't care, that's how much I swear!
Michael: Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
Andy: I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.
Michael: Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?
Darryl: Yeah, I did. I, I was talking to this girl at a bar.
Michael: Oh, no, no, no...
Darryl: I think she could... sense my sadness, and I, and I found out too late that she... she's the copy editor at the Trib.
Michael: Oh my god. Was she cute?
Darryl: No.
Michael: Oh, god, Darryl!
Michael: I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.
Jo: Sounds like you were as blindsided by this as I was.
Toby: Well, that's...
Jo: And we didn't find anything on your computer.
Toby: Good.
Jo: Except this. [hands stack of paper to Toby]
Toby: Oh, wow, this is, uh, just a mystery novel that I've been working on.
Jo: I know what it is. I skimmed the first chapter. I'm just curious, why would a man who hates people want to have a relationship with a maid?
Toby: Oh, uh, I don't know, uh...
Jo: The way I look at it, there's only one of two reasons. He knows a secret about her that she doesn't know herself, or he wants to use her services to mop up after a murder.
Toby: Oh... yes.
Toby: Write your own damn novel.
Pam: It was me.
Jim: What was you? You were the leak?
Pam: Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...
Jim: Uh-huh.
Pam: She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!
Jim: Why'd you do that?
Pam: Her husband's a reporter.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.
Jim: Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
Pam: I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.
Jim: This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Michael: You leaked it?
Pam: I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!
Michael: I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
Pam: That fast?
Michael: Oh.
Michael: Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.
Pam: [Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.
Michael: So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
Pam: Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.
Pam: [in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.
Darryl: All right, this is just messed up.
Michael: No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
Darryl: All right.
Michael: What do we got?
Pam: Um...
Kelly: [opening door] Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
Pam: We're not going for yogurt.
Michael: It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
Kelly: Guys, I couldn't help it, it is so boring where we work. I mean, it's as interesting as a morgue. It might be less interesting than a morgue.
Michael: Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
Kelly: Of course I'm the leak! I think I Tweeted it! I can't control what I say to people, I spend the whole day talking! I mean, I video chat, I Skype, I text, I Tweet, I phone, I Woof...
Ryan: Woof is a site that I'm launching to be the last word in social networking. For just $12.99 a month, Woof links up all your communication portals so you are always within reach. It's part of the dog pack, as I call it. But, look, why tell you when I can show you. [types on his phone] I just sent myself a Woof. [fax machine makes noise, several windows pop up on computer behind Ryan with accompanying sounds, including barking]
Erin: [on phone] Ryan, you have a Woof on line 1.
Ryan: Thank you, Erin. Woof!
Michael: Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.
Pam: Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
Michael: No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
Kelly: That idea sucks.
Pam: I don't think that's a good idea.
Michael: Just don't say no.
Darryl: Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.
Kelly: Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
Michael: That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
Pam: Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
Michael: Okay. You can count on me.
Dwight: [sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.
Toby: I'm hungry.
Dwight: Ready? [they pull the vending machine towards them; Dwight's phone rings] Got it? Oh shoot. Got it? [walks away, opens phone] Dwight Schrute.
Realtor: [on phone] The property you're looking at is in great shape. By the way, it has a very spacious basement office.
Dwight: Basement office? You mean like a lair?
Michael: Hey Jo.
Jo: Michael.
Michael: I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
Jo: Michael Scott... what do you know?
Michael: What?
Michael: It doesn't matter what I know.
Jo: If it doesn't matter, then tell me.
Michael: Why?
Jo: Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
Michael: Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]
Jo: Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak. [Jo's dog barks] Come with me.
Michael: What?
Gabe: [as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation?
Michael: Are you going to kill me?
Jo: Hahahahahaha.
Realtor: [on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.
Dwight: Okay.
Realtor: What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works?
Dwight: Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.
Realtor: But... [Dwight closes phone]
Michael: [on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police.
Creed: I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.
Gabe: All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.
Stanley: It wasn't me.
Gabe: What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]
Andy: What? Based on what?
Gabe: Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?
Dwight: All right. Sounds good.
Jim: Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Andy: Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.
Jim: Really?
Jo: Michael.
Michael: I have rights.
Jo: Let's just talk.
Michael: I am not going to tell you anything.
Jo: Honey, you don't seem like your normal self.
Michael: Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
Jo: Mama Jo knew there was something up.
Michael: Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
Jo: Oh, I hate that.
Michael: And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
Jo: Who's Holly?
Michael: Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
Kevin: Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?
Dwight: Oh, just...
David Wallace: I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it.
Andy: Gabe, I told you all about the printers.
Jim: I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.
Pam: Yes, it's totally obvious.
Creed: I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.
Nick: Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.
Gabe: Uh, not now.
Nick: Oh yeah, it's just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would...
Stanley: [quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?
Phyllis: I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...
Nick: My name is Nick.
Angela: Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.
Nick: Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me.
Jim: Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
Nick: You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?
Jim: No... sport.
Nick: You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?
Dwight: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.
Nick: Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what? [gestures to Ryan] You're not a photographer. [gestures to Kelly] And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you. [points to Andy] This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out. [gives the finger]
Andy: You're going to believe that guy?
Jo: When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me.
Michael: Hmm, hmm.
Jo: I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.
Michael: You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
Jo: Oh honey, surely you don't want that.
Michael: I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.
Dwight: I'm about to buy this building, you know.
Hank: You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.
Dwight: Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
Andy: Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?
Phyllis: [points to the ceiling] You deserve it.
Andy: Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...
Kevin: [offscreen] No, it does not!
Andy: Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.
Angela: It does!
Erin: Andy?
Andy: Hey.
Erin: I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.
Andy: Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.
Erin: Yeah.
Michael: [to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?
Jo: Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.
Michael: That was fun.
Jo: I hope your rough patch ends soon.
Michael: Thanks. Today helped.
Jo: Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.
Michael: Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
Jo: Let me see what I can do.
Michael: It is six a.m. [DeAngelo yawns] and we are about to go house to house to give everyone their Dundie Nomination Certificates. Just like the Oscars!
DeAngelo: Yes, and this happens every...?
Michael: Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend. [DeAngelo laughs]
DeAngelo: Well, you know, why don't we try it, and if it goes good it'll be part of my tradition.
Michael: Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
Michael: [arriving at the first house] Alright let's go! [DeAngelo runs in the wrong direction] This way, this way! [Michael knocks on the door]
DeAngelo: Thanks.
Michael: Surprise!
DeAngelo: Congratulations!
Jim: Yep, okay...
Michael: You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
Jim: Okay.
Michael: [holds up a camera and DeAngelo meows] Here we go! Have Pam come down.
Jim: No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Pam: What's going on?
Jim: Stay in bed!
Michael: [next house] Congratulations!
Stanley: Have you lost your mind! Get off my property before I call the police!
Michael: We got it.
DeAngelo: Uh, leave it at the door or...?
Michael: Yeah that's fine.
Michael: [next house] Hey Toby! You suck! [throwing eggs at his house]
DeAngelo: Is this an employee of ours?
Michael: [giggles] Go go go go go go!
Michael: [arriving at a dumpy looking, unkempt house] I've never seen this place in the daylight.
DeAngelo: It reminds me of Katrina.
Michael: Here we go, alright got it? Set? [the door is ajar, Michael knocks lightly] Hello? [turns around to see Meredith walking towards her house]
Meredith: I'm so busted! Walk of shame!
DeAngelo: Do you usually leave your door unlocked? And ajar?
Meredith: Ahh, Nice! I got a Dundie nomination!
Michael: Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
Meredith: No no no! You guys stay! No no no! I have Vienna Sausages and I have napkins. [walks into her house] Let me fix you breakfast!
DeAngelo: [whispers] I'm not going in there.
Michael: [quietly shuts the door] Go.
Michael: [walking into the office] Good morning Erin.
Erin: Oh hey, didn't see you.
Michael: You have big plans for tonight?
Erin: I don't know, maybe volunteer at the shelter, or go to bed, or... I don't know. Maybe I'm going to the Dundies!! [Flashes her Nomination Certificate]
Michael: You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.
Michael: The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.
Michael: Anything can happen at the Dundies! [DeAngelo laughs] They're like the Golden Globes but less mean. And I just want all of us to have a good time!
Dwight: Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Michael: Black tie optional.
Dwight: Every day is black tie optional!
Michael: A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Kevin: Nice! [rest of the office looks excited]
Phyllis: I love their breadsticks!
Pam: Oh, their breadsticks are like crack!
Ryan: I love when people say like crack when they've obviously never done crack.
Pam: Well the breadsticks are like what then, Ryan, what can I use?
Ryan: I don't know, something from your world. The breadsticks are like scrapbooking.
Pam: You're right, you're right. I'm a middle class broad. [Jim does his 'Jim face']
Michael: Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
Ryan: Yeah that's great.
Michael: So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]
Dwight: Always the padawan, never the Jedi.
DeAngelo: Thank you Michael, uh, but I will have to pass.
Michael: Think of it as part of your training.
DeAngelo: Not much of a performer, unless you count singing in the shower. Boy, okay...
Michael: [smiling] Okay, well we'll work on it.
DeAngelo: [whispers to Michael] Michael, I'm very, very bad.
Michael: You are doing it.
Michael: [all in conference room] Guys! I want you to help us work on some banter.
Kevin: Yes! I love banter. But I hate witty banter.
Michael: Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
DeAngelo: That is true, we do share some similarities. I know how you can fix one of those problems, for me it was portion control. For you, you need a key chain. Maybe one with a-
Michael: [cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
DeAngelo: This did not happen.
Michael: Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?
Ryan: Why don't you ask my therapist, my mom certainly pays her enough.
Michael: [very excited] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
DeAngelo: Uhhh, you sir! [points to Jim] Are we having fun tonight?
Jim: Having a great time.
DeAngelo: Oh good!
Jim: Thanks, yeah.
DeAngelo: Where were you on September 11th?
Michael: No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly]
DeAngelo: This is so weird! If I'm conducting a meeting, good to go. But if I think of it as a performance... I-I fall apart. Obviously.
Andy: Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.
Michael: No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
Jim: Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Michael: Jim, please no loopholes.
Darryl: Mike, why do you have to control how he perceives it in his mind?
Michael: This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
DeAngelo: [laying down, Michael is sitting on DeAngelo's stomach bouncing up and down in Michael's office] Me mo. Me mo.
Michael: Good. Good. Good!
DeAngelo: Meee Mo, Mee!
Michael: Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
DeAngelo: When I was very young, my mother divorced my father and I had to go to court and choose between them.
Michael: [getting off his stomach] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it. [picking up a portable tape player] Let's try this. Put these on. [DeAngelo puts the headphones in] I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't- [DeAngelo winces] That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this, [gives him a card] and make it sound perfect.
DeAngelo: THE DUNDIES ARE-OW-ABOUT COMING TOGETHER! AND RECOGNIZING, THE ADOMINABILITY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT! [Jim comes and closes the door]
Michael: Say it with an accent!
DeAngelo: [bad Australian accent attempt] THE DUNDIES!
Michael: [also in a poor Australian accent] The Dundies!
DeAngelo: THE DUNDIES!
Jim: [Jim and Pam are walking outside] I just don't understand the desire to push sweet potato fries on me, and not just regular fries.
Pam: Yeah... [they see Erin eating in her car, and ducking when they see her. Pam knocks on her car window] Hey, Erin, everything okay?
Erin: Get away from the car, he's gonna see you.
Jim: Who's gonna see us?
Erin: [desperately] Just get in! Get in! Just get in!
Jim: Get in the car? [Jim and Pam get in the back seat]
Erin: Please! Sorry. Get in. [Jim and Pam are confused and worried] Sorry sorry sorry.
Pam: What's wrong?
Erin: I eat lunch in the car now.  It's my alone time. It's just nice to have some time away from Gabe.
Pam: Why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend?
Erin: I, really don't like spending time with him.
Pam: Don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now? You know, rather than waste more of his time?
Jim: I think I'm gonna go.
Pam: What?
Jim: I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!
Erin: Thank you Jim.
Jim: I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.
Erin: I can't just dump him Pam, I'm not like you, I can't be mean.
Pam: Wait, when am I...? You just have to be clear and firm. You know, just tell him you don't love him. Just be honest with him. [Erin nods]
Dwight: [standing by the Louie Volpies entrance greeting people and giving them menus]
Kevin: [walks in] Hi!
Dwight: Appalling. [Meredith walks in] Eye sore. [Jim and Pam come in] Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Erin: DeAngelo, Jo's on the phone for you.
DeAngelo: Hello?
Jo: [Michael dressed as Jo Bennett, using a bad Southern accent] DeAngelo! We're in serious horse manure here! The Dundies are tonight! And we ain't got no host!
DeAngelo: Oh no!
Jo: Luckily I have someone for you!
DeAngelo: Billy Crystal?
Jo: Better.
DeAngelo: Neil Patrick Harris?
Jo: He's in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway. Now we need Michael Scott! The best darn Dundies host on both sides of the Mississippi! [everyone in the audience is laughing]
DeAngelo: Ughhh, I gotta find Michael Scott! And then I gotta, [Russel Brand impression] Get Him to the Dundies!
DeAngelo: [in the office near the accountants] Hey, can you help me find Michael Scott Angela?
Angela: [Michael is wearing a blond wig, talking in a high obnoxious voice] My boyfriend can, he's a state senator.
Audience: [laughing]
DeAngelo: Mmhmm.
Angela: Oh wait, he can't help because that title has no meaning!
Oscar: [laughing]
Oscar: Try Jim DeAngelo, he'll be able to help.
DeAngelo: Jim! Do you know where I can find Michael Scott?
Jim: [Michael is wearing a wig that is very close to Jim's actual hair, and he is wearing fake earrings, and speaking in a punk-ish deep voice] I totally don't know where Michael is, dude, hey you wanna listen to some records?
Jim: [shaking head at the camera]
DeAngelo: No one is listening to me! And I'm running out of time!
Phyllis: [Micheal dressed as Phyllis, pretending to knit] Well, what are you talking about? [cracking noise] Ohh! Ohh! [falls onto the ground] I've fallen and I can't get up!
DeAngelo: Maybe I just need to look into my heart. [in the bathroom in front of the mirror] DeAngelo, where is Michael Scott. [his reflection in the mirror turns around to reveal that it is Michael]
Michael: I'm here. [DeAngelo gasps and turns around] In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
Oscar: The analytical part of me wants to examine it, but I know it has no content.
Dwight: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand up for you co-host this evening, Michael Gary Scott. [Michael comes running up to stage as people applaud] Please remain standing for your other co-host, and new manager, DeAngelo Jeremitrius Vickers! [DeAngelo presents himself, and changes his mind and runs off] Was that part of the...?
Michael: [in the bathroom] DeAngelo, what are you doing? There's a live audience out there!
DeAngelo: Go do it by yourself, get Ryan.
Michael: No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
DeAngelo: This was not, part of the job description!
Michael: Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
DeAngelo: Who am I doing this for?
Michael: [slaps him] You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there.
DeAngelo: I can't. [Michael slaps him again]
Michael: Say it.
DeAngelo: Stop, hitting me.
Michael: You can do it, just say it.
DeAngelo: Hit me again. [Michael slaps him once more]
Michael: Now hit me. [DeAngelo slaps him] One, two, three.
Together: It's showtime.
Michael: Alright, here we go.
Michael: Okay! Okay! Sorry about the delay everybody! But we were at the DMV waiting in line. [everyone laughs]
DeAngelo: Fall asleep right after sex. Huh guys?
Jim: Nope, go back to the script.
Michael: There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie! [Dwight plays a celebratory honking noise on his keyboard]
Jim: Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Michael: Well done.
Jim: I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Michael : Alright. [all applaud Jim]
Pam: You didn't think to mention me huh?
Jim: Didn't I?
Michael: Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie. [Pam gets ready and Jim smiles at her] I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
Meredith: [jogs up and makes out with Michael, who is unwilling] Tell ya one thing, I'm not gonna be a good mom tonight! Whooo!
Dwight: Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
Jim: I gotta go do this.
Pam: [annoyed] Why?
Dwight: Big smiles folks! There they are.
Michael: Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to, [Ryan stands up] Danny Cordray! [Ryan quickly sits] Danny couldn't be here tonight...
Ryan: How do I feel about not winning Hottest in the Office this year? Uhm, I'm very relieved. How do you, how do you judge something like that? What is the criteria even? It's, it's so subjective.
Michael: Stanley Hudson is a grump, everybody knows that. [Stanley looks angry] But did you know, that Stanley Hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes. The Diabetes Award goes to Stanley Hudson! [Stanley slowly walks over, angry] Come on up here you sick bastard.
Phyllis: I have diabetes too. You don't see me making a big deal about it.
DeAngelo: They say he's going to be my right hand man, adlib masturbation joke. [realizing he wasn't supposed to read that directly off the cue card, speaks quietly] No, I hate this, I hate it so much. [loud again] Dwight Schrute! Please accept this promising Assistant Manager Dundie. [people clap as Dwight takes the microphone, he is obviously unenthused] Thank you, thank you so much. I would like to thank something that we, uh, take for granted in our daily lives. And that is the humble trashcan. [Creed nods] This is for you trashcan! [walks off and throws the Dundie into the trashcan]
Manager: [the manager of Louie Volpies approaches a giggling Kevin, who is coloring with crayons on the tablecloth] Who gave you those crayons?
Kevin: I brought them from home! Do you have a red?
Manager: This is a cloth tablecloth! You can't color on it!
Kevin: Oh really? [camera shows that Kevin has drawn a house on the tablecloth.
Michael: You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults? [manager looks up, angrily at Michael] Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award! [Erin looks thrilled and walks up to the stage]
Meredith: That is bull! [throws her Dundie]
Erin: Thank you, thank you! This is the first award I've ever won in my entire life. [Gabe and Andy smile at her] People are right about the Dundies, they are magical. But, I don't feel it. And I think that's because I'm not with the right person. Gabe, we should break up.
Gabe: What?
Erin: I'm not attracted to you. I just, I cringe when you talk. I have to be honest. Right, right Pam? [Pam looks very awkward] Thank you for hearing me.
Gabe: [stands up and walks to stage, takes the microphone] Well, this is embarrassing, um, I'm obviously really angry at Erin. It's that quarter life crisis everyone's been talking about. [Jim is looking wide eyed, jaw dropped] Alright I'm gonna go. [Dwight plays cricket noises]
Michael: [escorts Erin off stage] There you go.
Darryl: Damn that was cold.
Michael: It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers. [DeAngelo jogs up and takes the Dundie and tries to go back to his seat]
Audience: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
DeAngelo: Hold on, hold on one second. [puts on the headphones and turns the volume up all the way] I WANNA, I WANNA, I FEEL TRULY BLESSED! UHHH, TO BE WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU! BEFORE THIS ALL STARTED, FUNNY STORY, I WAS IN THE BATHROOM, VOMITTING, AND VOMITTING IN THE MEN'S ROOM!
Manager: Okay, okay. [trying to stop him from offending other people in his restaurant]
DeAngelo: THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN FOR MOST OF THE EVENING...
Michael: [stopping Manager] DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
DeAngelo: This is truly special, for me! And uh, anyway. It's so much lighter!
Michael: Okay, we're done! That's it.
DeAngelo: Michael, are we?!
Michael: We're done. We're done!
Michael: [Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...
Pam: Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!
Michael: What?
DeAngelo: I know I'm the cause of this royal screw up but I would like to see this show go on.
Michael: No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
Pam: Let's grab some ice cream, go back to the office, and finish what we started. [others nod in agreement]
Michael: So what you're saying is you kinda like it? [Phyllis impression] I've fallen and I can't get up! [normal again] That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
Jim: I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
Michael: That got a big laugh.
Jim: That did. Pretty huge laugh.
Michael: [to Stanley, who is cracking up again] You were laughing right?
Stanley: I was.
DeAngelo: [with Dwight and Michael outside Michael's car] You know what, I have to go to the bathroom.
Michael: We're really close.
DeAngelo: I can just run over to the gas station.
Dwight: We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Michael: That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
DeAngelo: Okay, fine I'll hold it.
Michael: [in the car] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
Dwight: I thought it was the worst Dundies I've ever been to.
Michael: Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
Dwight: Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
DeAngelo: [as Michael pulls over and stops the car] Please don't stop so suddenly, the seatbelt is pressing on my bladder. Why are you even wearing a seatbelt, you're sitting in the backseat, baby.
Michael: What is your problem?!
Dwight: I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Michael: Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
Dwight: And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
DeAngelo: [very uncomfortable] Look, what ever you're going to do, how long is it going to take? Ballpark. 'Cause I just, I gotta make a decision here. [gets out and slams the door]
Michael: He is in an all-out sprint.
Michael: [in conference room] Here... [Andy walks in] Okay! By his own omission, this person actually tried marijuana in college, so the Doobie Doobie Pothead Stoner of the Year Award goes to, Andy Bernard! [Andy walks up]
Andy: A lot of people I'd like to thank, but I think we all actually wanna thank you Michael.
Michael: Oh, okay. [nods to him]
Andy: I mean, we actually all really wanna thank you, for everything.
Darryl: [starts playing the tune to Seasons of Love while Andy sits down]
Michael: Oh my God, something's happening.
Andy: [singing] Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! We actually sat down, and did the math.
All: Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's how many minutes, that you've worked here.
Pam: In costumes!
Jim: And impressions!
Toby: In meetings.
Erin and Kelly: And cups of coffee.
Kevin: For birthdays!
Stanley: More meetings and-
Women: E-Mail forms you made us read.
All: Nine million, nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes! That's like watching Die Hard, eighty thousand times!
Meredith: You hit me with your car!
Ryan: You helped me get off drugs!
Creed: I watch you when you sleep.
Oscar: I forgive you for kissing me!
All: Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call. Remember to, call. Call.
Kelly and Erin: Call, text or e-mail, or call.
DeAngelo: [falsetto] Measure your life in love!
All: Remember to call, remember to, call. Remember to call.
Michael: [choked up] Yeah, okay. [pauses, then takes a deep breath] Well this is gonna hurt like a mother[bleep].
DeAngelo: [recall to Dundies at Louie Volpies] Every day, millions of Americans suffer from extreme repulsiveness. Someone in our midst, is bringing that problem to light. Toby Flenderson, please come up here and accept the Extreme Repulsiveness Award. Oh that's so mean!
Michael: No it's not.
Oscar: [Toby is shaking his head, no] It's his last Dundies.
Jim: You gotta play along man.
Oscar: Come on Toby.
Michael: Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it! [Toby comes up and take the mic]
Toby: I really disagree with this. I think it's kind of hateful. Though I am a little happy right now to have a platform to talk about the outcome of a case I was recently a juror on. The Scranton Strangler. That man's being put to death. I was part of the verdict, and I'm not so sure he's guilty any more. [Dwight plays a clip from the song Oh Yeah: Ohhhh yeah! Chica chicaaa]
Michael: [sitting on the roof of the office building] Well, I'm moving to Colorado to start my new life with Holly. Just up here, getting used to the altitude.
Dwight: [walking up] Michael?
Michael: Yes?
Dwight: I've got a treat for you!
Michael: Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
Dwight: Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
Michael: [Michael takes one and bites] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Dwight: [angrily] That's because they're Not oysters, they're bull testicles! I cut them off fresh this morning! [Michael spits it out] Hah!
Michael: Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
Dwight: What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Michael: I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay? [Dwight scoffs] The job was not mine to give. [sighs] Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Dwight: Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
Michael: Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
Dwight: Great idea.
Michael: ...in order to feed the bears.
Dwight: Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Michael: How do you mean?
Dwight: Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!
Michael: Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
Dwight: Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Michael: Okay.
DeAngelo: [with Michael in his office] You're not gonna take all these toys are you?
Michael: Hm?
DeAngelo: I mean you don't have a job lined up, so it's not like you have a desk to put 'em on.
Michael: Well I have interviews.
DeAngelo: That's nice. [reaches and a grabs a toy truck] How 'bout that truck? Can I have this little truck? I was thinking I might... glue a stapler on top. Or put a hole here, stick pens in it. [Michael gives an obviously fake smile] You okay?
Michael: Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
DeAngelo: You know what? Uh, it's your last couple days, I'm gonna get out of your hair.
Michael: Oh you don't, that's-
DeAngelo: I will be in the break room.
Michael: That sounds good. Thank you.
DeAngelo: Dead man walking.
Michael: Sad? No, no, no. I don't leave 'til tomorrow, so... Tomorrow I will be a wreck.
Gabe: [sees Andy walk into the Men's Room and follows him in] Stay away from Erin! [cornering him in the bathroom]
Andy: Hey!
Gabe: I'm your boss!
Andy: Why don't you, uh, stay away from me?
Gabe: No, I'm gonna stand where I want. Okay? You don't wanna get on my bad side! I've seen some horrible things! I own over two hundred horror movies!
Andy: Okay! That's so weird! Just go away!
Gabe: No! You go away! [storms out, toilet flushes, Jim exits the bathroom]
Andy: [weak] Hi Tuna.
Jim: So you guys are filming people when they go to the bathroom now?
Phyllis: [in the conference room with Pam, Angela, and Meredith] How about cupcakes?
Angela: Please.
Pam: What's wrong with cupcakes?
Angela: Everything.
Michael: [walking in] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Pam: Well we all wanted to plan your goodbye party. We thought this would be easier.
Pam: We thought.
Angela: It's an experiment.
Phyllis: The three of us have all been chairmen before.
Pam: So this is the dream team.
Meredith: [walking up behind the glass] Hey! What are you saying?!
Angela: The dream team... and Meredith.
Meredith: [to Michael] We decided on the ice cream. Mint chocolate chip, your favorite.
Michael: Mmm!
Phyllis: Yeah that was a surprise...
Michael: You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
Pam: [surprised] Okay.
Michael: Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
Pam: Should we get toppings?
Michael: What do you like Pam?
Pam: [confused] What?
Michael: What kind of toppings would you like?
Pam: Hot fudge?
Michael: Sounds good. Fudge it up! [all seem surprised at Michael's behavior]
Michael: [holding up his 'World's Best Boss Mug'] I bought this for myself. And yesterday, they gave me this. [holds up a Dundie that reads, 'World's Best Boss 2011, Michael G. Scott', throws his mug into the garbage can and places his Dundie at the front of his desk] I still need something to drink out of though.
Michael: [pulls out a list of everyone in the office, then puts it back in his jacket] Attention everyone, before I leave tomorrow I would like to reveal a secret I have kept for over twenty years. A secret about Phyllis.
Phyllis: Please Michael.
Michael: When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute. [Phyllis looks relieved] And she still is.
Phyllis: I thought he knew about the baby I gave away.
Phyllis: [holds up mittens she's knitting] Look Michael, it's a going away present so your hands won't get cold.
Michael: Ahh.
Phyllis: It's almost done, but you can't get them wet, and they can't be dry-cleaned either. You have to hand wash without water, wring-dry gently, and use a hairdryer on cool.
Michael: [hesitantly] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well! [goes into his office and comes out with a bag] And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind. [presents to her a mouth wind-up chattering toy]
Phyllis: It's cute. [plays with it]
Michael: Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt. [gives Stanley a small felt table] May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
Stanley: Where's the rest of it, it's got no balls.
Michael: Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts. [other salesmen look outraged]
Andy: Wow.
Stanley: [angry] Yeah wow!
Andy: You know I'm the worst salesman here right?
Michael: But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
Phyllis: What does that even mean?
Michael: You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
Andy: I'm gonna lose 'em.
Michael: You're not gonna lose them.
Andy: I promise you that I will.
Michael: Just do your best! I have faith in you.
Stanley: [as Michael walks away, Stanley whispers angrily to Andy] Gimme those clients!
Andy: No.
Phyllis: [to Dwight] Do you believe that?!
Dwight: I've given up expecting Michael to do the right thing. Or the decent thing. Or even the comprehensible thing.
DeAngelo: I used to be obese. Once you've conquered obesity, everything else is easy. Life literally moves in slow motion. I'm not saying I'm superman, but, let me just put it this way. If I were shot in the head, I'm pretty sure everything would be fine. I almost welcome it. [winks]
Michael: Kevin, I have something for you.
Kevin: Oh! [Michael unrolls it to reveal it is a caricature of Kevin as a pig eating pizza]
Michael: You know who that is?
Kevin: Oh...
Michael: [rips the poster in half] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
Kevin: Better...
Michael: Good, stand up. [Kevin does so] You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
Kevin: But...
Michael: You will find love.
Kevin: Michael, I'm pretty much okay with who I am now.
Michael: Don't be. You should never settle for who you are. [moving on] Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
Andy: I just lost Porter Hardware! I just, I lost 'em!
Michael: [quietly groans] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this. [takes a sack tied in the upper middle making a crude head, with a face drawn on, obviously the product of poor craftsmanship, Oscar pretends to like it]
Oscar: Thank you Michael. It's beautiful.
Michael: [laughing] It looks like a [more laughing] It looks like it was made by a two year old monkey on a farm! He just accepted, accepted that I put all this work into it! [laughs more] He has the lowest opinion of me, of anybody!
Michael: Was it just me, or did you think that we were going to have sex at some point?
Angela: It was just you...
Michael: How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
Oscar: State Senator.
Michael: Mmhmm, bravo!
Oscar: Brava!
Angela: You wanna see some pictures? I just got these.
Michael: Sure!
Angela: Uhm, these are, okay this is us at the theater. And antiquing! Oh, rollerblading.
Michael: Who's that? Who's that guy? [points to second guy in the pictures]
Angela: Oh, that's Thomas, Robert's aide.
Michael: I guess this could be the one, huh?
Angela: Yeah. [Oscar shakes his head no]
Andy: [walking into the kitchen, DeAngelo is using the coffee machine to cook chicken covered in melted chocolate] Hey.
DeAngelo: [hurriedly, while hiding the chocolate covered chicken] Hey!
Andy: I'm going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.
DeAngelo: Let's rip it up homes. [smacks top of the door frame with his hand, leaving a chocolate hand outline]
Gabe: [Andy walks by with DeAngelo, says quietly after he leaves] Walk away bitch.
Oscar: [Michael is leaving the accounting area] Oh Michael! Where do you want your last pay check sent?
Michael: My last pay check?
Oscar: You have an address yet in Colorado?
Michael: No.
Oscar: What town do Holly's parents live in?
Michael: I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
Kevin: Sounds beautiful!
Pam: [Michael sits alone eating at the back of the kitchen, Pam comes in with Jim, Creed and Kevin] You should do more stuff like that.
Kevin: I'm going to!
Jim: [to Michael] Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Michael: Nah, I'm almost done.
Jim: You sure?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: So I'm going to Carbondale this afternoon to get a new bulk shredder.
Kevin: Finally! That old shredder sucked.
Pam: It's a good shredder, it just keeps breaking.
Kevin: Yeah, it won't shred magazines.
Pam: It's not supposed to shred magazines Kevin.
Kevin: I know...
Jim: Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Kevin: No, it's just... that old shredder sucks. [Michael looks tearful] Just get one that'll shred magazines.
Pam: I don't think any of them are supposed to shred magazines.
Michael: [crying] I can't do this. All the channels are gonna be different there. I'm not gonna be able to find my shows. I'm not going to start improv at level one, and I don't think my credits will transfer. Ugh, and you know what? I just figured out where I was supposed to go to vote. [picks World's Best Boss mug out of the trashcan and puts it back on his desk] I gotta call her, and I'm going to tell her, that I cannot come. [dials on his phone]
Holly: [on phone] Hello there!
Michael: Hi. What is the name of our town?
Holly: Boulder. Is something wrong? Are you okay?
Michael: No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
Holly: [Yoda voice] Oh you mean this?
Michael: [laughing] Yes. [Olive Oyl impression] Yes my hero!
Holly: [deep man voice] I'll pay the rent! [Michael laughs] Okay, my mom's looking at me and she has no sense of humor. It's a joke mom!
Michael: [laughing] Ohh, I miss you.
Holly: Well I'll see you tonight. I'll pick you up outside baggage claim.
Michael: Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
Holly: I love you too.
Michael: [hangs up and composes himself] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four. [looks at the list of members of the office, with some names crossed out] And I have said goodbye to half of them.
Toby: Well you know Michael, I have a brother in Boulder. Rory Flenderson. You should look him up.
Michael: [grimaces and nods, Toby nods back at him] Okay.
Toby: [smiling] Okay.
Michael: [walks over to Kelly] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
Kelly: [doing make up and irritated] What?!
Michael: If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
Kelly: Yes! Please! Please go away! And stop using that weird slow voice.
Michael: [in Ryan's office, which is illuminated blue] She was once my girl, and she is your girl now.
Ryan: Wow. [camera pans over to show that the light is from Michael's St. Pauli Girl Sign, hanging in Ryan's office]
Michael: Yeah.
Ryan: This is... totally unnecessary.
Michael: You're not prone to seizures?
Ryan: No.
Pam: [in conference room with the party planning committee] So Michael said we can do whatever we want cake-wise. What do we want?
Meredith: [quickly] Erotic.
Angela: See? This is what happens. You can't let a stray dog into the house.
Phyllis: Hmm, let's hear here out. I would like to hear more about these cakes. [Angela and Pam look uncomfortable]
Meredith: I know these Ethiopians that run a cake shop.
Angela: Good God...
Meredith: They make these cakes, they're wild! I mean, they show everything!
Pam: I don't, I don't think we sh-
Meredith: I know what you're thinking, but it's not just black, they do it all. And the women on these cakes, they're not just guy's fantasies. They have real, full women. It is refreshing.
Pam: [stopping her] Okay, don't turn this into some feminist issue.
Phyllis: As a person who buys a lot of erotic cakes, it feels good to be represented on one.
Pam: You know what, I think we should get some other input.
Kelly: I think we should do cupcakes. I am one of the few people who looks hot eating a cupcake.
Phyllis: Yeah, cupcakes. That's what I said.
Angela: No! I'm not cleaning up a bunch of uneaten cupcake bottoms! You know, we don't really care about your opinion. You're just a tie-breaker.
Michael: [sees Pam walking towards the door of the office] Um, Pam.
Pam: Oh, hey Michael! I'm just going to go to Carbondale to price some shredders. I'll see you later.
Michael: [disappointed] Okay... [Jim is confused]
Erin: [walking into the women's bathroom, Gabe storms in after her] Gabe!
Gabe: I need to talk to you!
Erin: You can't be in here. This is a lady's room!
abe: Erin, I respect your privacy, but I will follow you in here everytime you go if that's what it takes. [Creed walks out of one of the stalls]
Erin: Hey Creed.
Creed: Not cool man. [walks out]
Erin: I really think you should leave.
Gabe: Someday, you are going to tell our grandchildren about how their grandfather won you back in a women's room.
Erin: Can we talk about this later, I have to go.
Gabe: Just read the letter under your windshield wiper, it explains everything. Quick one. [leans in for a kiss]
Erin: Gabe!
Gabe: Okay... [walks out embarrassed]
Toby: [on video cam with his brother] Here's the thing Rory, I knew you guys would hit it off in an odd way.
Rory: I can bring him a welcome basket. I'll surprise him.
Toby: Do- Well you should give him a little time to settle in. But-
Rory: Does he like jams? My shelves are over flowing with preserves.
Toby: Well, no. He hates jams.
Michael: [walking into Darryl's office] Darryl!
Darryl: Hey.
Michael: I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage. [hands him a thin black folder] Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
Darryl: That's sweet Mike. Let's see here. There's a chapter, called Gum. With one sentence. Everybody likes the guy who offers him a stick of gum.
Michael: Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.
Darryl: No. Can't let you do that Mike.
Michael: No problem. Worth a try.
Michael: [in warehouse] Darryl said I could use the bailer because I'm leaving.
Warehouse Guy: No.
Michael: [picks up a basketball and dribbles it away from the basket] Alright guys, well... see ya later warehouse. Catch you on the flippity flip. [throws the ball behind him and misses the basket, tries and misses several more times]
DeAngelo: [in car with Andy] okay, so what's our approach? You a veteran? Do I have a month to live? You gonna get married tomorrow? What? [Andy stares blankly] Hmm?
Andy: I thought we'd just talk about our customer service and exceptional paper quality.
DeAngelo: That's stupid. [laughing. Nervously, Andy laughs with him]
Andy: [joking] What do I know?
DeAngelo: [still laughing] What do you know? We gotta get psyched up! Okay? Guy? Let's get psyched! Is there an animal shelter on the way?
Andy: [confused] Yeah.
DeAngelo: Awesome! Ani Ani Shelto! Here we come. Do you know how to high-five?
Andy: Yeah!
DeAngelo: Cause if you do now's the time.
Andy: [going for it] Alright.
DeAngelo: Not while I'm driving.
Michael: [still trying the backwards basket] Catch you guys- [forklift drives in front of the camera] Catch you guys on the filippity flip. [misses and picks it up again] Flippity flip! [misses again and grabs it back] Flippity flip! [makes it in, gets excited] Really? [composes himself] Okay, see ya guys! [walks away, containing his self-pleasure]
DeAngelo: [at the animal shelter with Andy] You know how I met Jo Bennett? And got started on my ladder of success?
Andy: No. I don't.
DeAngelo: [hands Andy a dog] I'm walking along, out of work. Again. Thinking to myself, 'I only have enough cash to by a sandwich, or get drunk. And I see this guy trying to steal this lady's dog! So I grab the dog. He runs off. She's so grateful, she hires me.
Andy: Awwhh, wow.
DeAngelo: Gimme that dog! That's not your dog! [takes the dog from a confused Andy] Yeah! Again.
Andy: Oh, okay...
DeAngelo: Gimme that damn dog you f***ing thief! Don't ever do It again! [Andy nods modestly] You hear me?! [Andy nods again] You feel that energy?
Andy: Mmhmmm.
DeAgnelo: Wooo! Yeah! [parades in circles with the dog, pretends to whack Andy with it] [giving it to Andy] Okay, again.
Erin: I know that Gabe is young, and hot and everything. And he's begging me to reconsider, but I... I just think I'm in love with someone else.
Michael: Kevin?
Erin: Andy.
Michael: Ahhhh...
Erin: I wish I knew who my birth mother was, so she could just tell me who to choose.
Michael: Maybe neither.
Erin: I'm not attracted to Kevin.
Michael: Erin, listen to me. You shouldn't rush into this. At all. And you know why? Because you are beautiful. And you are fun. And you are smart. [Erin is smiling] And when the right guy comes along, you'll know it. You will. [kisses her head] And you know what? You don't need a mom. Because you have my number, and you can call me anytime.
Erin: [nods] Extension 147.
Michael: N-
Erin: I know.
Michael: Okay. [both chuckling. Michael leaves Erin, looking thoughtful]
Phyllis: [on the phone] You want the 27-26 or the 27-30?
Michael: Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
Phyllis: No. [trying to finish her sale when Michael hangs up the phone] I'm on a sale!
Michael: Listen to me. It's two p.m. From now until four, your priority is knitting. Knit like the wind.
Phyllis: Okay... [Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Michael: Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow. [pulls out an envelope from his jacket]
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: So I wanted to give you that. [hands him the envelope] It's a letter of recommendation. [Dwight looks eager. Michael nods to him and walks away]
Dwight: This is gonna be good. [eagerly reading the letter] To whom it may concern. [off to the side] Good, real personal. Thanks Michael. [reading again] The dictionary defines superlative as: of the highest kind, quality, or order, surpassing all else, or others. Supreme. [to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute. As a sales executive, as a leader, as a man, and as a friend, he is of the highest kind, quality, and order. Supreme. [holding back tears] Lot's more like that, really repetitive. What's this? [pulling out a small card from the envelope. Reads it] Two forty five, behind the building. Paintball. [checks his watch quickly] Ohhh, yeah.
Dwight: [opening his trunk excitedly and gets out his paintball gear, takes his gun and looks for Michael, gives up, Michael jumps out of the dumpster shooting, they shoot each other, yell, laugh, and taunt, having a great time]
Michael: [in the office, crosses Dwight off his list. He has paint in his messed up hair, and is containing his laughter]
DeAngelo: [giving his and Andy's pitch to a client] I would just like to start off saying, I have not worked with Mr. Andy Bernard for very long, I can say, is that he is no Michael Scott. I can't sit here and tell you he's gonna be a success. I can't sit here and tell you that he's even the best man for the job. [Andy looks awkward] But I can say this: He's got potential. Sure. You know, I always say: go big, or go home. You go with This guy, you could be making the biggest mistake of your life, OR, the biggest, Good decision of your life. It's either gonna be the best thing you ever did, or the worst thing you ever did. If you want some boring, white bread clock-watcher who's gonna get you your paper when you ordered it, for the agreed upon price, [Andy looks hopeful] Andy's not your guy. [Andy deflates] You ever play Russian Roulette? [scoffs] Time to spin the chamber horse. By signing up for another year. [hands the client a folder he needs signed for another year's contract]
Jim: [Michael walks into the office, still a mess] Ahh, what happened to you?
Michael: You should see the other guy.
Dwight: [smiles knowingly]
Michael: [looks at the clock to see it is three o'clock] Jim where is Pam?
Jim: Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
Michael: But it is already three o'clock! [Michael leaves, Jim gives a knowing look to the camera]
Pam: [walks into a movie theater showing The King's Speech]
Michael: [in his office talking to Creed, Gabe, and Meredith in that order] Whether you're scared of dying, or dying Alone, or dying drunk in a ditch. Don't be. It's going to be okay.
Michael: Yeah I was tripling up. There's not enough time in the day to have a special moment with everybody.
Michael: [Gabe is still standing in front of Michael's desk] And you, why are you still here.
Gabe: [sounding hurt] I'm either going to quit today, or stay to make sure that Andy's career is destroyed.
Michael: No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice? [Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]
DeAngelo: [walking out the client's room with Andy] That is cold sir! Absolutely cold. You know what? It was a complete waste of my time.
Andy: Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.
DeAngelo: [grumbles] Okay whatever.
Andy: [walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.
Client: Keep talking.
DeAngelo: [on his phone waiting for Andy, next to their car] Yes. Okay, alright. No, well thank you! Alright, take care. [hangs up] You'll never guess, we did it!
Andy: [laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!
DeAngelo: We did it!
Michael: [standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]
Stanley: Yes, what is this about?
Michael: What is this meeting about?
Stanley: Mmhmmm.
Michael: Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
Phyllis: They're almost done but my knuckles are swelling a little and-
Michael: [cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Stanley: Is that it?
Michael: Umm, hmm?
Stanley: Is that it?
Michael: [the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!
Jim: Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Michael: Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!
Jim: [brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Michael: [sad] Ohh...
Jim: What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
Michael: [holding back tears] Okay...
Jim: You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
Michael: Maybe.
Jim: Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
Michael: Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
Jim: Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Michael: [pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...
Jim: You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jim: And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]
Michael: [hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.
Jim: Alright.
Michael: Alright.
Jim: Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
Michael: I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
Jim: [shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
Michael: I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
Jim: [chuckles] You got it.
Michael: Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.
Phyllis: Oh no, they're still not done.
Michael: No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]
Creed: [drinking from Michael's World's Best Boss mug] See ya tomorrow boss!
Michael: Later guys. [leaves the office]
Michael: Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?
Michael: [putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]
Pam: [watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.
DeAngelo: [all are in the conference room for Michael's party. Michael isn't there. Jim gives the camera a knowing look] Well if he's not gonna make it at least we should go ahead and eat the cake. [Kevin nods] I for one love the corners. [cuts a corner piece, picks it up with his bare hands, and takes a bite] Why'd I just do that? It's not even that good. I don't even want it. I had cake for lunch. [throws the piece in the garbage] No, you know what? I've been good. I deserve this. [grabs a piece from another corner. The office groans] What am I doing? [chucks it into the trashcan] Come on DeAngelo! [DeAngelo tries to lick the cake, everybody yells no]
Dwight: [to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]
Deangelo: So, coasting time is officially over.  Big changes are comin', and they're comin' fast.  If you don't like 'em, this is called a door.  You can walk right through it.  Alright.  I'm not here to be your friend.  I like my life outside of this place.  I live to leave at 5.  Change number one: Darryl.  Per your request, the company is sending you to business school at night.  Full ride.  Deal with it.
Darryl: Seriously?
Deangelo: Stone cold seriously.
Deangelo: They are trying to figure me out.  And I don't like it.  Once they figure me out, they start to tell me what I want to hear.  And I need to quickly figure out who's a good worker and who is simply a good mind reader.  Because as soon as I'm hearing what I want to hear, I'm not gonna care.
Deangelo: Change two, Toby, you're gettin' a new chair.
Toby: Thanks.
Deangelo: Don't thank me!  Hey, don't thank me, guy!  Okay?  And I don't care if you like it.
Oscar: These sound like good ideas, why wouldn't we like them?
Deangelo: I don't care what your favorite flavor is.  Here's a bowl of ice cream.  You either like it or you don't.  [Andy nods] That's my attitude right now in this room, that's my attitude on Ice Cream Thursdays.  Alright?  Clear?  Any questions?
Kevin: This all sounds great to me.  [hesitates] But I could see how some people might think that they're bad.  I don't know what to think.
Deangelo: That is a s--  astute observation, Kevin.
Deangelo: Kev's got me pegged.  [chuckles]
Deangelo: It blows away Vermont in the fall.
Darryl: Snap, for real?
Pam: Good morning, Deangelo.
Deangelo: Hold on.
Pam: Okay.
Deangelo: [continuing to talk to Darryl] And if you're really serious, you should go in the spring.
Pam: Because of the flowers.
Deangelo: No.  Because the entire state smells like Earth.
Pam: Dogwoods, or just the Earth.
Deangelo: Yes, Pam.
Pam: Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.
Deangelo: Put it with the rest.
Pam: Okay.
Deangelo: [entering his office] Hey dudes!
Jim: Hey!
Andy: Hey!
Pam: Oh my God, he hates me!
Jim: No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
Pam: I know.
Jim: Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].
Pam: Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?
Jim: Careful.  There is no inner circle.
Andy: Oh, there's an inner circle.  Oh yeah.
Jim: There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.
Kevin: Jim only says that because he's in the inner circle.  I also say that because I am also in the inner circle.  Did you get that, Ma?  Your boy, Kevin Malone, is IN the inner circle!  [thinks] Which doesn't exist.
Deangelo: [holding two cups of coffee] There he is!  Got ya coffee.  [offers cup to Dwight]
Dwight: Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]
Deangelo: Not a coffee guy, I take it.
Dwight: It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Deangelo: Listen.  I've got a sixer.  'Automatic for the People' on the jukebox.  Let's hit the park after sundown.  Come on!  Pick up some sausage if you want.
Dwight: I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.
Deangelo: No matter how many times I reach out to Dwight, he doesn't seem to want anything to do with me.  It reminds me of my relationship with my son.  Except there, I'm the Dwight.
Deangelo: Who's the biggest client in the state?  I say we go get 'em, whatever it takes.  Huh?  What do you guys say?
Kevin: Yes!
Deangelo: Right!  Or my other idea, 50,000 tiny clients.
Kevin: Yeah, I say we just go for it!
Deangelo: [shoots mini basketball at hoop on office door, misses badly] Is that ball lighter than usual?  Is that a Chinatown knockoff?
Jim: That's Toys R Us, I think.
Deangelo: No, that's definitely a knockoff.  You can feel the center of gravity's off.  Feel that.  [throws ball to Gabe]  What do you think?
Gabe: [holding ball in open palm] Oh, yeah, totally.  Jim, you got ripped off big time.
Deangelo: [calling for the ball] Deangelo! [shoots and makes it]  See what I did there?  That's what you need to do.  [makes shooting gesture] It's that little English.  The British are coming.
Kevin: Yes.
Deangelo: Deangelo's open!
Deangelo: Hey Ry.  Your department's killing it, baby. [puts arm around Ryan]
Ryan: Hey hey, my pleasure, my treasure.
Deangelo: Keep it up.
Ryan: The problem with having 'It' or 'the X-factor' or whatever it is you want to call it, is that it's impossible to put into words what you're bringing to the table.  So to make things simpler for Deangelo, I just, without lying, strongly implied that I'm Kelly's supervisor.  It's not even that much of a stretch.  She pretty much does whatever I say.
Kelly: What?
Ryan: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Kelly: Why should I pretend that you are my boss?
Ryan: Because what would you have done in that situation, Kelly?  I'll tell you what I would have done for you.  I'd lie for you.
Kelly: Yeah, but you lie all the time.  You lie for no reason.  Ryan, you just like to lie.
Ryan: I'd die for you too.
Kelly: You really would?
Ryan: [hears Deangelo entering] Hey, Kelly Kapoor, if I don't have those call logs on my desk, we're just gonna have to evaluate your future at the company!
Kelly: Sure thing, Mr. Howard.
Deangelo: Woo.  Glad he's not my boss.
Ryan: [whispers to Kelly]  You're the best.  Thank you.
Deangelo: You know I have a cousin who cracked the secret formula for a certain popular cola that I shall not name.  So I've never had to buy it.  True story.  I just drink my cousin's.
Dwight: Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
Deangelo: You know what... straight up, why don't you like me?
Dwight: I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
Deangelo: Ohhhh no.
Dwight: What?
Deangelo: Okay?  I'm gonna win you over.
Dwight: No you're not.
Deangelo: Yes I am.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Oh yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.
Dwight: No.
Deangelo: Yes.  Yes-yes-yes-yes-yes [starts to run out of the break room] yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes-yes!
Jim: [looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'
Darryl: The winner: under 'Special Skills,' Mr. Don Feiner put 'Juggling.' [laughter]
Deangelo: What's wrong with juggling, Darryl?  I'm a big juggler.  I actually perform a motivational juggling routine.
Jim: Seriously?
Deangelo: Oh yeah.  I'd do it for you here, but uh, what would you say this room is, 300 square feet?  320?
Gabe: 320.  Just freeballin' it.
Deangelo: It's a little cramped.  How many square feet out there?  17, 18 hundo?
Kevin: Oh, I think it's 18 hundo.
Gabe: Give or take. [Deangelo walks out]
Deangelo: Sorry gang.  Thought my juggling stuff was in the trunk of my car.  It's not.
Pam: Oh no, do you think it was stolen?
Andy: I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!
Deangelo: Sorry, I never touch another juggler's instruments.  You know, we're all here, I've got the music cued, why don't I just do my routine without the juggling balls? [starts to play 'Wake Me Up Inside' by Evanescence] Prepare... to go into the danger zone.  [begins pretend juggling routine]
Pam: Oh wow, you weren't kidding.
Deangelo: No.  Never.  Can someone please throw me a fifth ball?  If you dare!  [Kevin pretends to throw ball]  Incoming!  And we're on!  Remember, nothing's impossible!  Phyllis, where's Phyllis?
Phyllis: [raises hand] Here.
Deangelo: Do you believe in me, Phyllis?
Phyllis: Yeah.
Deangelo: Because I believe in you.
Phyllis: Okay.
Deangelo: [pretending to bounce balls off Phyllis at close range]  Feel that connection?  Don't move your head.  Please.  Thank you.  Oh!  Big hand for Phyllis!  [clapping]  That took a lot of guts!  [finishes routine]  Ho!  I'm Deangelo Vickers, thank you so much, hope you learned something.
Kevin: Didn't drop a single ball!
Pam: [imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.
Jim: What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
Pam: What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?
Jim: He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
Angela: Of course you do, Jim.  You're a man.  Deangelo is a huge sexist.
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.
Angela: Okay.  Then how about I'm the head of the Accounting Department, but he only ever talks to Kevin?  What about Pam and Kelly?  Also department heads.  But has he ever met with you or even asked you to do anything?
Andy: How could I not see it?  You're so right.
Pam: [to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?
Jim: And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'
Pam: Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?
Jim: Mmm-hmm.
Andy: And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?
Jim: Hey, you got a second?
Deangelo: Yeah, I got tons of time.  This job's a joke.
Deangelo: So what's up?
Jim: Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Darryl: [opening door to Deangelo's office] Hey, saw Jim come in.  We meeting?
Deangelo: Yeah sure.  Let's make it a meeting. [Darryl, Kevin, Gabe enter office]
Jim: If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Deangelo: What's the big secret?  Why are you even whispering?  Come on, it's the guys!
Jim: I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
Deangelo: Uh-oh.  Right?
Kevin: Hot!
Jim: Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
Darryl: Damn!
Jim: Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
Deangelo: Are you serious?  Who feels this way?
Jim: Oh.  Like nobody.
Gabe: Umm, Pam?
Jim: It was --
Gabe: Was it Pam?
Kevin: That sounds like Pam.  You know how she gets.  Deangelo, she can get really bitchy.  [begins bad imitation of Pam] Kevin...
Deangelo: Guys.  Hold on.  Doesn't matter who, okay?  I'm just happy that Jim brought it to my attention because honestly, I had - I had no idea.
Jim: That's awesome.
Deangelo: Thank you.
Kelly: [on phone] Mom, Ryan's taking us out to dinner tonight.  No, no, he's not going to stand us up like he did last time.  He won't ever stand us up again.
Ryan: [joint talking head with Kelly] So I am the new customer service supervisor.
Kelly: When Deangelo's around.
Ryan: And I am also a very dutiful boyfriend when --
Kelly: All the time.
Ryan: All the time.
Deangelo: Erin, do you mind running down to the lobby and bringing up my brand new executive assistant?
Erin: Absolutely.
Jim: Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
Deangelo: Oh, I'm glad you asked, Jim.  Because apparently there's a rumor running around here that I am a sexist.  I can't work here effectively if you guys think I'm something that I am not.  I am not a sexist.  Raise your hand if you have a vagina.  [Deangelo raises hand, Kelly and Pam sheepishly raise hands] Raise your hand if someone you love has a vagina.  [Deangelo raises other hand, along with rest of office] Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Just about everyone.  What about Deangelo's hand?  Oh wow.  He's got 'em both up.  [Ryan raises both hands]  Yeah.  Uh huh.  [others raise both hands] Yeah, so it bothers me when I hear that there's gossip around here that I treat women lesser than men.  Okay?  Frankly, we all look a little ridiculous when that happens.
Phyllis: I'm not a feminist, but I think that the men in this office are being given chances that the women aren't.
Deangelo: Dwight, what's your take?
Dwight: What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Deangelo: Man, you're smart.  [Erin arrives with new executive assistant]  Oh, hey!  Hi!  Hello.  Welcome.  Uh, everyone, I'd like you to please welcome Jordan Garfield.  This is everyone.
Jordan: Hello.
Pam: So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?
Jordan: No, Anthropology.  We don't have this in that size, pretty lame.
Kelly: Lame?  You worked at Anthropology?
Jordan: Yeah.
Kelly: That's like my dream job.  How did you even get that job?
Jordan: Well, I umm -
Kelly: You chose this job over that job?
Ryan: Okay, okay, back to work, Kelly, we have a lot to get done today.
Pam: So, umm, is this your first office job then?
Jordan: Yeah.
Deangelo: Yup.
Pam: Wow.
Deangelo: No corporate experience whatsoever.  I didn't want anyone with any bad habits.
Kevin: [heading into Deangelo's office] Jim, you coming?
Jim: Oh yeah, did he text us?
Kevin: Yeah. [Jim looks at cell phone as Dwight's phone vibrates]
Dwight: [holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!
Pam: Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.
Jim: He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes]
Andy: Yes!  I'm in.
Angela: Andy, what are you doing?
Andy: I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]
Pam: [to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.
Deangelo: Internally, for office use [Jim quietly enters Deangelo's office and sits down] where do we get our paper from?  Do we go -
Jim: [to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Deangelo: [staring at Jim] Hey Jim.
Jim: Yeah.
Deangelo: Can I help you?
Jim: Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office]
Dwight: So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?
Jim: Well, there is no inner...circle.
Jordan: Dwight?  Deangelo wanted me to ask you if there's anything I can help you with.
Dwight: Really?  Anything.
Jordan: Do you need anything?
Dwight: Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Andy: Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --
Jim: So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.
Pam: So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.
Ryan: Hey!  Kelly, that's the last time I'm gonna talk to you about your paycheck!  Okay?  We pay you a fair salary here, and if you're only here for the money, maybe you shouldn't be here at all.
Deangelo: No one likes a money grubber.
Kelly: I'm sorry, Mr. Howard, I apologize for grubbing for money.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I'm sorry.  I just can't do it.  Deangelo, Ryan is not my boss.  Okay?  Frankly, he hasn't had a real job here in years.
Deangelo: Ohh.
Ryan: Oh, that's hilarious, Kelly.
Kelly: No, he's just a big fraud, Deangelo.  He's like Rango.  He doesn't work here, basically.  Just like the way Rango didn't save those animals.  It was just a big misunderstanding.
Deangelo: Is this true, Ryan?
Ryan: I did not see Rango.
Deangelo: Okay, I don't have time for this he said-she said.
Kelly: He's not saying anything!
Deangelo: It's too murky.  I like Ryan.  You seem kind of hysterical to me.  Ryan's your supervisor.  Let's just leave it that way.
Kelly: That's not fair, I mean, I've been working here for such a long ti-- [Deangelo walks away]
Ryan: [sighs] Oh, close call!  Okay, why don't you just finish this up and leave it on my desk and I will see you at your place around 2 am.
Pam: [knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?
Gabe: Well, that's gonna be tough, because we're getting a dunking clinic from Magic Jordan himself.
Deangelo: [chuckles] Oh, you mean Michael Jordan?
Gabe: [laughs] Total brain burp.
Deangelo: I'm no MJ.  I can do his dunk.  From the free throw line.
Kevin: Whoa.
Darryl: Daaamn!  Mad respect for my brotha!
Darryl: The man is paying me to take Chinese.  I will say what I need to say, and soon, I will say it in Chinese.
Pam: Okay, well it's just really loud.
Deangelo: Okay.  We'll keep that in mind.  Alright, ladies, back to the game.
Darryl: Do it!
Deangelo: Jim!  Come on in.
Pam: You're back in.
Jim: You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
Deangelo: Yeah, we'll set that up one day.
Jim: Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
Deangelo: Yeah, I don't know.
Jim: Why not?
Deangelo: Only because no one has called NASA to request a liftoff. [laughter] Let's go downstairs!  Okay?  Let's do it.
Dwight: Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Deangelo: Damn it, Dwight!  Enough!  Get your ass downstairs or find a new place to sell paper! [Dwight immediately gets up and walks out]
Dwight: Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.
Jim: Alright, there you go.
Deangelo: Seems a little close, you sure that's the real foul line?
Jim: 15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Deangelo: Nah, that's 15.  Yeah.
Jim: Okay.
Deangelo: And uh, you know what, to make it interesting, Jordan, why don't you sit underneath the basket?
Jordan: Seriously?
Deangelo: Yeah, come on.  I'll dunk over you.  Best seat in the house.
Jordan: I don't, I don't think I can do that.  I'm holding your jewelry.
Deangelo: Right.  Yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  Kevin, you do it.
Kevin: Yes!  Okay. [sits down in front of basket]
Deangelo: Someone want to sit in Kevin's lap?  Angela?
Angela: No.
Deangelo: Oscar?
Oscar: No thank you.
Deangelo: Okay, Jimmy, this is for you.  Show you that anything is possible.
Jim: Fantastic.
Deangelo: Alright?
Jim: Yup.
Deangelo: This is also for the troops.  [backs up, bounces ball, starts running, jumps, lands in front of Kevin, jumps again, pulls himself up by the net, dunks ball, hangs on rim]  Doctor is in! [hoop starts to fall] Ahhhh! [hoop crashes down on Deangelo]
Jim: [ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?
Erin: [Deangelo enters office in hospital gown with bandage on his head] Deangelo?
Deangelo: [speaking gibberish] Tablab.
Jim: Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?
Erin: Who should I say is calling?
Jim: Erin.
Deangelo: [lots of gibberish] says to bartender [lots more gibberish]  Droswip.  Droswip.
Gabe: Droswip, yeah.  I get it.  Okay, we're gonna get you to the restroom.
Pam: We could get Deangelo flowers.
Dwight: No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Phyllis: That's true.
Jim: All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]
Dwight: Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]
Jim: Nope. Baskets have it.
Jim: So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.
Jim: [on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.
Dwight: [on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]
Jim: Wait...
Pam: What have you done?
Dwight [on phone]: Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.
Mose [on phone]: Aaaaahhhhh!
Pam: Can't stay there all day.
Jim: I'm coming.
Pam: Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?
Jim: You'd slow me down.
Jim: Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.
Pam: Stop stalling! Come on.
All: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation...
All but Oscar: ...under God...
All: ...indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. [Kevin finishes behind the rest of the group]
Angela: Amen.
Dwight: Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.
Erin: Ooh, about what?
Dwight: That's on a need-to-know basis.
Erin: I thought I needed to know for your calendar.
Dwight: [quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
Jim: Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Dwight: Define foment.
Jim: You define foment.
Dwight: [clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.
Dwight: [surprising Kelly] Aha!
Kelly: Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
Dwight: Gotcha! Why are you late?
Kelly: It's none of your business, actually. It's very medical and personal.
Dwight: All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]
Andy: In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...
Erin: Oh! Darryl's funny.
Andy: I know, right?
Gabe: Hey, Andy?
Andy: Yeah?
Gabe: Can I talk to you a second about these client memos?
Andy: Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe]
Gabe: Are you still in love with Erin?
Andy: What?
Gabe: Because I am. I need to get her back. [crying] I can't be alone anymore. Andy, do you like being alone with me right now?
Andy: No, this is horrifying.
Gabe: No. I don't like being alone with me either, okay? I have to get her back. Are you still gonna date her?
Andy: We're just friends, okay?
Gabe: Do you promise that?
Andy: Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?
Gabe: No, just give me a second. I don't want anyone to know I've been crying.
Dwight: [seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?
Jim: Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.
Dwight: You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?
Jim: Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]
Dwight: Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.
Jim: And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]
Kevin: [inputting numbers into the copier and holding up the line] One...
Stanley: [refills his coffee near a sign that reads 'Honor System: $0.50' with a camera pointed at it]
Andy: Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]
Dwight: I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.
Kevin: [looking at empty vending machine] No food now? Someone has to do something about Dwight!
Creed: He put some snacks in the freezer for us.
Pam: You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?
Creed: No. The blueberry Slurpee pouch.
Phyllis: He means the ice pack.
Erin: [on phone] 2:00 should probably be okay. I can either take your number or - [Gabe ends the call]
Gabe: I'm sorry. This can't wait.
Erin: He's just gonna call back.
Gabe: Erin, I am in love with you. I don't believe in much, okay? I don't believe in horoscopes. I don't believe in Christmas. Uh, uh, I sure as hell don't believe in God. [Erin and Angela both look taken aback]
Erin: [quietly] What?
Gabe: Or maybe there's a God. I don't know. I mean, it's just not a guy with a long white beard. [Erin looks shocked] Or it could be. I mean, it's possible that that is exactly what - what God is. But for all of the disbelief [phone rings] I believe in us. I believe in love. You have made me believe that for all of the hokum [phone continues ringing] out... there... uh, do we not have voicemail?
Erin: Dwight doesn't trust robots to give us our messages.
Gabe: Well... it's just... [ringing] it messes up my rhythm.
Erin: I'm taking a break from dating. Gabe was a great guy with so many wonderful qualities, but it was a challenge being touched by him.
Jim: Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.
Dwight: Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.
Jim: And the desk.
Dwight: The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.
Jim: I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Dwight: Don't make me fire you.
Jim: You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.
Dwight: Don't make me pre-fire you.
Jim: You wouldn't dare.
Dwight: Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.
Jim: [quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.
Dwight: What?
Jim: If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.
Dwight: How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan: I'm good.
Dwight: Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.
Jordan: Why are you telling me this?
Dwight: Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.
Dwight: [walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.
Pam: Dwight, are you carrying a gun?
Dwight: The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.
Andy: Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.
Dwight: The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.
Pam: Why do you need to wear the holster at all?
Dwight: Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
Angela: Thank you.
Phyllis: You could put your cell phone in it instead.
Dwight: Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt]
Kevin: You could put a banana in it.
Dwight: Why would I put a banana in my holster?
Kevin: In case you weren't hungry now, but you got hungry later.
Pam: Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.
Dwight: Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]
Erin: Andy!
Andy: Aah! Aah! It's so loud!
Oscar: My God. There is a hardwood floor underneath this carpeting. Why would they do that?
Andy: [trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.
Meredith: Okay, everyone make a list of what's lost for the insurance. I lost a necklace, a ring, a painting-
Toby: Hey, what happened?
Kelly: Dwight went on a shooting spree, and then he shot Andy in the head.
Dwight: No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.
Andy: [scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.
Oscar: I'll look on WebMD. What are your symptoms?
Angela: Oh, everybody. Oscar found a reason to look on WebMD.
Oscar: [buzzer to indicate a blocked site] Firewall.
Gabe: I can't reach Jo. She must already be on the plane.
Dwight: Okay, why are you calling Jo?
Andy: I think I should go the hospital.
Erin: I'll go with you.
Gabe: No! We really shouldn't be without a receptionist. Now more than ever.
Darryl: I'll take him.
Andy: Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]
Darryl: What's wrong with you?
Andy: It's my ear.
Darryl: Yeah.
Andy: Okay, sorry.
Toby: [excitedly] Oh, I should get the accident report binder. I've never used the gun violence forms before.
Gabe: I'm gonna keep trying Jo.
Dwight: Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Dwight: [enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.
Stanley: We all saw you do it.
Dwight: Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Erin: Navy blue. Little red anchors.
Dwight: I have no way of knowing if that's true.
Toby: I am supposed to collect eyewitness accounts. Who saw Dwight do this? [all raise their hands]
Dwight: Okay, really?
Toby: Would you consider this a terrorist incident?
Ryan: I felt terrorized.
Dwight: Come on.
Toby: Oh, there's a whole 'nother terrorism booklet for that.
Dwight: I just really, really think we should handle this internally.
Ryan: Dwight, why is it on us to protect you?
Dwight: Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
Andy: Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.
Dwight: There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.
Andy: Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.
Dwight: Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.
Andy: Yeah.
Phyllis: How's your hearing?
Andy: Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.
Darryl: I was talking like this. [mouths words while pointing to his ear] I don't feel good about it, but he just kept calling himself a gunshot victim and it got to me.
Kelly: Dwight, I would like tomorrow off so that I can go on my American Idol audition.
Dwight: American Idol? What? No.
Kelly: Okay. I guess I can just not go. Do you guys wanna hear my solo?
Dwight: No.
Kelly: [singing] Why did my temporary boss go on a shooting spree?
Dwight: Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.
Phyllis: Okay, well, then I want an extra vacation day.
Angela: Pet Day! I want Pet Day back - no dogs.
Kevin: Put back everything in the vending machine except the fruit.
Dwight: I put everything back in the vending machine.
Kevin: Put everything back in the vending machine except... the fruit.
Pam: You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.
Dwight: Okay.
Jim: Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Dwight: Thank God.
Jim: Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Dwight: What's jazz hands?
Jim: [quickly shakes his hands back and forth]
Dwight: Fine.
Dwight: [leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet]
Kevin: [after entering the men's room] What the [bleep] is that? [runs out of the bathroom] Oh, my...
Jo: Hey, all! Cornelius, Bobo, have at it. Nobody let my dogs hump each other. They don't seem to know they're brothers.
Dwight: Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?
Jo: Slow yourself down there. Just like a man. Wants to jump right into it while I still got my socks on. Jim Halpert - the only man that ever turned me down.
Jim: Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Jo: Well, some pretty big shoes to fill. I was sorry to hear about Deangelo. He was a good man. Tragic. [Jim coughs]
Dwight: [does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.
Andy: We have to clean this up now!
Erin: She had so much -
Gabe: Hey, guys.
Erin: Hey.
Gabe: Hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Andy: No! [Erin and Andy laugh]
Gabe: Hey, Andy, did you tell Erin about our conversation earlier when you said you would never want to date her again?
Andy: Uh...
Gabe: I just thought that it was so interesting that you promised that.
Andy: Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...
Gabe: No, I was not.
Andy: And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.
Dwight: Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?
Kevin: Hey, Dwight, gimme a back massage.
Dwight: No, Kevin, come on.
Kevin: My back is sore, Dwight. Massage it.
Dwight: Kevin, not now.
Kevin: Hey, Jo!
Dwight: Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]
Kevin: No, under the jacket.
Dwight: You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.
Kevin: I don't feel anything.
Dwight: Oh, it's so wet.
Kevin: Push harder, Dwight.
Dwight: I can't. I can't push harder!
Kevin: Go a little higher. There you go. Nope, higher. Higher. [Dwight has positioned his feet on the filing cabinet behind Kevin and is kneading his back horizontally]
Dwight: Okay, how's that?
Kevin: Knead it. Knead it like a pizza.
Dwight: I'm kneading it!
Kevin: Don't eat it.
Jo: Dwight! Walk me out. Let's talk soon. And stay on top of these people. You gotta admit it - it's nice to have a little power, eh? How's it feel?
Dwight: Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.
Jo: What?!
Dwight: I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
Jo: Shooting is worse! Are you kidding me? It's not even in the same - you shot a gun? What is wrong with you?
Dwight: It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.
Jo: Beaumont-Adams is a girl's gun. That just makes it plain stupid.
Dwight: I take full responsibility.
Jo: Who else would be responsible?
Dwight: Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
Pam: You shot a gun off -
Dwight: Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.
Jo: Oh, stop asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius.
Dwight: Got it.
Jo: I love you, Dwight. But you don't fit this job.
Dwight: [on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -
Jo: No, child. No. It's over. Now I gotta find a replacement for my replacement.
Jo: You three are my search committee. You're in charge of finding me my next manager. All righty?
Gabe: Yep.
Jim: Yep.
Jo: Till then, we need a new acting manager. Now, who's got the most experience in this office?
Toby: Uh, well, we probably don't want to go just on seniority.
Jo: Who is it?
Jim: Hey, Dwight. What's up?
Dwight: Shut up.
Jim: Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]
Angela: [giving Kevin numbers for the copier] Four, one, seven, one...
Kevin: Another one?
Darryl and Angela: Yes!
Angela: Seven, two...
Oscar: Could you turn the volume down on the beeping?
Angela: Six, nine, shut up, Oscar. Eight...
Darryl: Nine first.
Angela: Nine, eight, five...
Kevin: Thank you.
Angela: Three, zero, zero. Again, zero. Four, six...
Kevin: Nice.
Angela: Two, one...
Kevin: Oh, I hit three. I hit three.
Angela: God!
Creed: [drives up to the entrance of the building, his license plate reads 'NEW MGR'] It's a beautiful morning at Dunder-Mifflin, or as I like to call it, Great Bratton. [gets out of car, tosses his keys toward a nonexistent valet parker] Keep it running.
Creed: Do I love being manager?... I love my kids. I love real estate. [slowly getting more excited] I love ceramics. I love my job. I-I love wrestling.
Creed: [to Jordan] Find out what language this is. [speaking in strange language]
Creed: [running a meeting in the conference room] Okay, team building! On this side of the room, Stanley, Phyllis, Jim, Ted, Elroy, [camera switches to show only Meredith and Kevin have attended the meeting, Jim walks by and sees this] and this side of the room, Pam, Meredith, Phyllis, Creed...
Jim: He never called a meeting.
Creed: [pointing at a whiteboard with BOBODDY written on the left side, vertically] BO-BODDY! BO-BODDY. What does the first 'B' stand for?
Pam: What are we doing?
Creed: We're making acronyms. Okay! What does the first 'B' stand for?
Kevin: Um... Business!
Creed: I like it! Business! Good, Kevin! [writes after the first B, I, Z, N, U...] All right! The 'O'...
Pam: We need a new manager.
Jim: [conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?
Fred Henry: Absolutely--I, yes. In fact, I actually have a three-step plan that I believe could effectively double your profits.
Jim: Really?
Fred: Yeah.
Jim: [waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?
Fred: Nice try.
Toby: I'm sorry, what is your three-step plan?
Fred: Well, I mean, I can't just hand you my plan. I mean, if you guys give me the job, then, then you'll get the plan.
Gabe: Well... it's an interview, and we don't know that you really have the plan.
Fred: [speaking faster] Well, I'm not gonna just make up that I have a plan. I got a plan. Believe me, you guys want it. You're in paper, right?
Gabe: How would we know that, if you don't...
Jim: You could just be saying it to get the job.
Fred: I guess I could be, if I was... who would do that?
Jim: How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
Fred: Tell you what. I'll give you part three of part two. Not gonna give you a whole part.
Jim: Okay.
Fred: Color-code sent documents, TM.
Jim: Did you just trademark that...
Toby: [confused] W-What?
Fred: That's a verbal trademark. That's an agreement.
Jim: We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.
Stanley: [in elevator with Phyllis and Darryl, all three are smiling, to Darryl] Good morning.
Darryl: Good morning.
Phyllis: [also to Darryl] Good morning.
Darryl: Good morning.
Phyllis: Did you have a nice drive in?
Darryl: I did.
Darryl: I have a solid relationship with Jo, the company's owner. I have management experience. I have a good friendship with Jim, the head of the Search Committee, and it doesn't hurt that I'm... [in Oprah-like sing-song voice] bla-aaack!
Andy: [puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering]
Erin: [commenting on the poster] It's good. I really hope you get it!
Andy: The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.
Erin: Still, I'd really like to see this office with you in the boss's chair.
Andy: Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!
Erin: You in the boss's chair!
Andy: EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.
Andy: In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.
Erin: [checks to see that she is alone with Phyllis] Did you hear anything?
Phyllis: Oh, I'm sure they'll let us know when they get the results. [Erin crosses fingers and smiles excitedly]
Phyllis: It turns out that Erin was born in the basic time and region that I gave away a child.
Erin: So, Phyllis might be my mom. I mean, the chances are tiny, but...
Phyllis: But, probably not, I mean, it was a big year for babies. Porky's had come out.
Erin: Yeah. I'm sure I was just another Porky's baby.
Phyllis: Mm.
Erin: But why not find out.
Phyllis: Yeah.
Pam: [to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?
Dwight: They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Pam: Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?
Dwight: Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
Warren Buffett: Can you do any better on salary?
Jim: Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Warren: What about mileage when I use my car? I mean, gas ain't cheap, you know.
Jim: Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Warren: How about 27? And uh, when I make long-distance calls, will they be monitored or is it on the honor system?
Angela: [on phone] Okay. [hangs up, smiling] How odd, a very unusual phone call from the Senator's office. The Senator wants me to have lunch with him at The Botanical Gardens.
Kevin: The Botanical Gardens, Scranton's hidden gem. Don't eat any berries you don't recognize.
Toby: How will your experience selling refinery equipment translate to our smaller scale here?
Robert California: You don't work in sales, do you.
Toby: Uh... Human Resources.
Robert: You see, I sit across from a man. I see his face. I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he wants a hundred dollars of paper or a hundred million dollars of deep-sea drilling equipment? Don't be a fool. He wants respect. He wants love. He wants to be younger. He wants to be attractive. There is no such thing as a product. Don't ever think there is. There is only... sex. Everything... is sex. You understand that what I'm telling you is a universal truth,... Toby.
Toby: Yes.
Gabe: Okay, I-I am, I'm almost a little concerned that you might be overqualified for the position. [Robert and Gabe chuckle at this, then Gabe stops chuckling] Do you, um, do you think that you are?
Robert: Do I look like someone who would waste my own time?
Gabe: No. [Robert then nods his head at Jim]
Jim: Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Robert: Will you be heard? Will you have a voice? Will I steamroll over you? Do you feel heard right now, Jim? Do you have a voice, right now? You can answer me.
Jim: Yes.
Robert: That was your choice, not mine. The fallacy is that it is up to the steamroller. It is up to the object... whether it will be flattened or not, and I can tell from the small interaction we've had already, you won't be flattened by anybody. Do you agree with me, Jim?
Jim: Yes.
Robert: [more emphatically than Jim] Yes. You do. [nods at the Search Committee, then looks over at the camera with a smirk on his face]
Jim: [Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.
Andy: [Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.
Darryl: [pats Andy on the back] Thank you.
Darryl: Think about it! What other mammal, besides humans, drinks the milk of another mammal? I mean, you don't see a bear drinking raccoon milk.
Jim: [Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.
Darryl: So this is cool. I think we make a good fit. [stands up]
Gabe: Oh? Uh... we haven't started the interview yet. Were you--were you joking?
Darryl: Uh... [looks at camera] yes?! I was. [sits back down] Little joke!
Toby: So, how would you go about settling interpersonal conflicts within the office?
Darryl: I thought that was your job.
Toby: Well, it's one of my strengths, but it's the manager's job.
Jim: Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Darryl: I'll answer that, Jim. I would use it as an opportunity to teach, uh, about actions... and consequences... of actions. [Jim and Gabe stare at Darryl]
Darryl: [noticing Erin in the background leading a black man dressed in a suit through the office] Who's that?
Jim: [ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Darryl: I... I just thought you knew me.
Jim: Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]
Darryl: Let me... [Jim shows him the resume again, Darryl looks at it a little longer this time] Oh. Cool. [Jim gives Darryl a thumbs-up, then looks at the camera as Darryl gets up to leave]
Merv Bronte: [at the cafe on the first floor] Did, uh, you just interview?
Robert: Ohh, unfortunately, yes.
Merv: What do you mean?
Robert: That business can't attract anyone. It's awful up there. Those people seem like they're in prison, waiting out life sentences in a... dying industry.
Merv: Place must be horrible. I don't know if I want this job. [gets on elevator]
Merv: [in elevator] Well, if I get this job offer, and then I know that I'm gonna take it, and if I take it, I know that I'm never gonna quit, and then 25 years are gonna go by and... I'm gonna die here.
Dwight: What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.
Robert: I just did.
Dwight: You can't.
Robert: It's done.
Dwight: No, it's not.
Robert: I know you now, your nature. I'm done. Not worth continuing. [at the same time, Dwight says:  You don't know me! Anything about me! Get out of my head!]
Dwight: Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
Robert: I saw an episode of how they make paper on Sesame Street. [nods at Dwight mockingly]
Dwight: [standing up] Get out.
Dwight: I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.
Merv: You guys pay for relocation, though, right?
Toby: Well, why would you need relocation, if you already live in Scranton?
Merv: Well, I'd want to move further away, you know? Just... I don't want any chance to run into my co-workers outside the office.
Jim: Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Merv: [pulls out a tupperware from his briefcase and takes out a tupperware] I'm leaving my other job because they were all jerks, really. [opens tupperware] You know, all of 'em. You had your jerk-wads, and your jerk-offs, so, just between the wads and the offs, I just... I had to get outta there. [begins eating sandwich]
Jim: Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Merv: I'm having a bad time. [chuckles]
Toby: I'm sorry, if we did something to upset you, I'm sure it was inadvertent.
Merv: [continues to chew, slower and slower, appears confused] Wait.
Merv: Oh, why did I believe that weirdo in the lobby? These are the nicest people I ever met.
Angela: [limo driver lets Angela out of the limo at the office parking lot] Thank you.
Pam: [looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.
Kelly: Yeah, I actually know about nice rings and it is gorgeous.
Meredith: [looks at ring, whispering] Wow...
Angela: It's a little flashy. I mean, what am I? Naomi Judd?
Meredith: Tell us the freaking story!
Kevin: Yeah! Tell us a story.
Angela: Okay. He took me to the replica of Monet's Japanese bridge, and then he put this flower behind my ear, which normally, I would hate, 'cause it's so civil rightsy. Then he got down on one knee, and he said, will you be a Senator's wife?
Pam: [laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?
Angela: Yes, Pam. Not everyone is as informal as you and Jim. [imitating Jim's voice] Oh, hey Pam, dude, whatever, wanna marry me? [Erin, Kelly, and Meredith laugh]
Pam: That's not accurate.
Angela: Then I saw flashes. Reporters were there. They always find us. And everyone was crying, even his aide. [camera pans and shows Oscar in disbelief]
Oscar: Angela's engaged to a gay man. As a gay man, I'm horrified. As a friend of Angela's, horrified. As a lover of elegant weddings, [smiles] I'm a little excited. [expression becomes serious again] But overall, horrified.
Jim: Andy? You all set?
Andy: Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.
Phyllis: Are you sure this is a good idea? I hate to see you disappointed.
Andy: [grunts] Augh.
Erin: I think Andy should be the boss. He's just so great. If I'm being objective, then Darryl, of course.
Jim: So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?
Andy: For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]
Gabe: Whoa! That's a very heavy accusation to level against Toby.
Andy: I wasn't acc-, accusing...
Gabe: Well, Toby's in charge of Human Resources, that would include communication. I think that Toby's done a fine job.
Andy: Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.
Toby: I didn't think you were.
Gabe: I have two relationships with Andy. I have a personal relationship, and I have a professional relationship. Personally, yeah, I think he's a rat, and I think he's responsible for the demise of my relationship with Erin. Professionally,... he broke up the happiest couple in this office!
Gabe: How many windows are there in New York City?
Andy: What?
Gabe: Critical thinking. Common, on-the-spot question asked in an interview.
Andy: Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?
Gabe: No... How far away is the Sun?
Andy: [happily] Uh, 93 million miles.
Jim: [to Gabe] Is it?
Andy: Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...
Gabe: Shut up about the Sun! SHUT UP about the SUN! [slams fist, hurting his hand]
Andy: [alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!
Darryl: [on phone] Yes, there used to be a paper clip that would pop up and say 'Looks like you are writing a letter or resume. Would you like help? I believe his name was... [looks embarrassed at camera] Clippy.
Creed: [on phone] First of all, I want to thank you for your years of patronizing our company. I've got some bad news. We're going out of business. [covers phone, whispers to Pam] Saving face. [uncovers phone] Yep, yep. I understand that. Basically everything is falling apart here. Pam looks around the office and realizes only she has overheard this]
Pam: How is this on me?
Pam: Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.
Creed: [takes the pictures] Okay I already see one, gimme. Okay.
Pam: They're the same picture.
Kelly: Well, I manage my department, and I've been doing that for several years now. And, god, I've learned a lot of life lessons along the way.
Jim: Your department's just you, right?
Kelly: Yes, Jim, but I am not easy to manage.
Gabe: Great! [to Jim and Toby] Um, can we just... [does a 'wrap it up' motion with his pen]
Kelly: What was that?
Gabe: We just have a lot of serious candidates to get through today, so... [nods]
Kelly: [getting upset] Am I not a serious candidate?
Gabe: What do you want me to say? I mean, there's a line of qualified people out there. We have a video CV from England. [to Jim and Toby] Are we all just gonna pretend to-- okay. [to Kelly] Um, what are your weaknesses?
Kelly: I don't have any, assh***.
Dwight: [comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.
Dwight: [walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?
Jim: Good!
Dwight: Good. They good?
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
Jim: Peepa.
Dwight: Peepa, how is she?
Jim: Great.
Dwight: Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Jim: No.
Dwight: Now, listen,...
Jim: You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Dwight: Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
Jim: [pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.
Dwight: I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
Jim: Yikes.
Dwight: Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
Jim: Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]
Dwight: Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back]
Jim: Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Dwight: Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim]
Jim: Thank you.
Dwight: Okay. [looks ashamed]
Oscar: Pam... I think Robert is gay.
Pam: The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.
Oscar: [whispers] So!?
Pam: And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.
Oscar: I have a very strong suspicion.
Pam: Did you see him at a bathhouse?
Oscar: What bathhouse?
Pam: The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.
Oscar: [confused, whispers] What?
Pam: Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.
Oscar: My friend at the Scranton Blade is totally plugged into these matters.
Pam: You're in the gay mafia.
Oscar: You're thinking of another group. Much wealthier, much older. [whispers, smiles] You sound ignorant.
Ryan: You guys, um, talking Senator?
Pam: No.
Oscar: No. Why would we be talking about the Senator?
Ryan: Cause he's totally gay? [walks away]
Ryan: Um, how do I know that Robert is gay? He 'liked' my facebook photos at 3 o'clock in the morning.
David Brent: [on video resume on a laptop] Name? David Brent. Occupation? Inspirer. Status? None of your business. Young, free, and single, though. Thanks for asking. Hear you're looking for a new boss. Yeah? Someone to tell a bunch of discontented, underencouraged drones what to do every day. Is that it? Oh. Our out-of-touch powers that be? Want me to fire them, if they don't see things your way? Then I ain't that dude. Bye-bye, baby, bye-bye. Get some other corporate suit to lay down the law. What? You've changed your mind? You're now looking for a leader of men? Ipso facto, women too. [points at self] When do I start? Yeah. [Jim looks uninterested in this candidate]
Phyllis: Do you know what it took to get Bob to notice me? I waited in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears. I did that every day for two weeks. And on the tenth day he walked in, he was naked too, except a dog nose. Guess what we did then?
Erin: [trying to cut off Phyllis] I... I don't think I can do that.
Phyllis: Bestiality. Yeah.
Erin: Well, that's not my personality.
Phyllis: If my daughter were asking me... [both giggle]
Erin: Yes?
Phyllis: I would say, if you want someone, if you really want them,... go get them.
Erin: I do really want him.
Darryl: So, uh... here you go. [gives resume to Jim]
Jim: Great.
Darryl: Hope it's all right.
Jim: I'm sure it's fine.
Darryl: The guy who was in here earlier, interviewed after me, how'd he do?
Jim: Howard Cline?
Darryl: Ehh, that's not who I'm talking about.
Jim: [checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.
Darryl: Yes. How did he do?
Jim: He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Darryl: Come on man. I'm being serious. Don't joke.
Jim: Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away]
Nellie Bertram: First, I'll take down the cubicle walls.
Toby: But there aren't...
Nellie: Symbol of transparency. There'd be no titles. Everyone would have the same job. Same goes for me. I'd take your job, but I'd reject the title.
Gabe: A little un-specific.
Nellie: Everyone would be known for their accomplishments.
Jim: That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Nellie: Ooh? Yeah. Mm. Scratch everything from before. I tell you what I'd do. Go the other way. More cubicles. More division. Everyone is somebody's boss, and that person can fire the person below them. [overlapping comments by the Search Committee] At least once a month, the lowest performing person... [does a cut-throat hand gesture] bye bye!
Gabe: How would you compare, like, an accountant and HR?
Nellie: Well, I'll tell you how. Shall I? I'll tell you how.
Gabe: Okay.
Nellie: By splitting the difference. Just... just, somewhere in the middle.
Jim: I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
Nellie: Zen office. Hmm? Thought of that? That's what I'd do. Everyone takes their shoes off, before they come in. Okay. There'd be no desks. You just sit on the floor.
Jim: That's very...
Nellie: You've got a Thai woman, out in the back. Sockee! Sockee!
Gabe: Okay, that's not gonna be...
Nellie: Sockee!... is her name. Okay? Shes administering massage, all right, if you need it. If you don't, whatever, just talk to her! She's a person! Either way, 50 minutes of that and you...you are cracking to go. [smiles]
Oscar: Is there a front runner?
Jim: You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
Oscar: Well, there must be someone who stands out.
Jim: No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
Oscar: Well...
Stanley: The hell you will! I worked for the last boss for 15 years. According to my doctor, I don't have another 15 years if I want to keep up the same dietary and sexual lifestyle, which I intend to.
Ryan: [in mock seriousness] Oh no, Stanley... you'll live forever...
Stanley: My next boss will be my last boss. He'll be at my funeral. So I would appreciate it if you would take this seriously. [dunks his half-eaten donut in Jim's coffee, takes it back out, and leaves]
Jim: Uh--
Meredith: You pick a crappy boss, you're responsible for my crappy life. [leaves]
Jim: Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
Oscar: Are you? [leaves]
Ryan: Little advice? Take a day off from the whole Jim schtick. Try caring about something. You might like how it feels... James. [closes his office door, leaving Jim alone in the break room]
Jo: [walks in with her dogs] Gabe, honey! Oh, lord. Take all this. [gives the dog leashes and multiple bags to Gabe]
Gabe: All right.
Jo: Here. Jim! Did you hear Stern this morning?
Jim: No, was it good?
Jo: Ohh, Robin was good. She's always good. Keeps him on his toes. Its Howard's show though. [picks up resume from Jim's desk] Whose is this? Darryl Philbin. Ohh. Very nice to see a familiar face on top. Ah... a little long aren't we? Four pages? Is this the same Darryl Philbin who's had two jobs in ten years at one company?
Darryl: Yes, thanks to you, who promoted me, after we, uh, interfaced.
Jo: Coordinated and implemented receipt storage and delivery of over 2.5 billion units of inventory. 2.5 billion, Darryl? 2.5 billion units of what?
Darryl: Paper material, ma'am.
Jo: Paper material?
Darryl: [softly] Pieces of paper. [Jo rolls her eyes]
Dwight: [clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
Jo: Or what? You gonna shoot me?
Dwight: Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
Jo: I'll interview you right now.
Dwight: Okay.
Jo: Question 1. Ever shot a gun in the office?
Dwight: It's complicated.
Jo: Yeah, but see... it's not.
Phyllis: I don't think we should tell her. Angela went a whole day without telling me I had lettuce in my teeth. Screw her.
Pam: I'm a woman. I would want to know.
Meredith: Yeah, you gotta know.
Kevin: Okay, but if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe I could get a lesbian to marry me? Huh? Huh? That's hot.
Oscar: You have met a lesbian in real life, right?
Phyllis: You know, this is probably is her last chance at a family.
Pam: She does seem happy.
Oscar: You're right. You're right. She seems happy. We don't tell her.
Kevin: We don't tell her.
Pam: Okay.
Kelly: Excuse me, Ms. Bennett, may I have a word?
Jo: Okay.
Kelly: Uh,... can it be in private? [to Gabe] Don't worry, it's not about you. [Gabe smiles and leaves] As Minority Executive, I think it's my responsibility to let you know that Gabe is gross. I don't think it's professional that he was sleeping with the receptionist, and then when Erin dumped him, so that she could be with Andy, he became a total crazy stalker psycho.
Jo: Welcome to Scranton, Jo. Land of a thousand problems only you can fix. [Jo's phone starts vibrating, she picks it up and sees Dwight has texted her 'Dwight's ability as a manager has lead him to higher levels of proffesional success,'] Oh for god's sake. He's texting me his resume one line at a time. These are costing me ten cents a piece, you jackass! I'm roaming!
Creed: [to Jordan] Get me our biggest client on the phone, right this instant. [closes his office door]
Jordan: Who is our biggest client?
Pam: Uh, just put him through to me.
Jordan: [laughs] Okay.
Pam: Hello! This is... the client.
Creed: It's Creed. FYI, I'm starting my own paper company, looking to poach some chumps, you in?
Pam: Yes.
Creed: Hehehe, cool. Let's keep this on the QT, okay? I uh, I don't want you to be a dead mamma jamma.
Pam: Great.
Creed: All right, thank you, bye-bye.
Pam: Thank you, bye-bye.
Erin: [knocks and enters] Jo, you have one more candidate. He's a burn victim.
Jo: Huh?
Erin: [motions toward her face] He's all messed up. I can tell him to get lost if you want.
Jo: No, send him in. [to Search Committee] Who is this?
Gabe: I have no idea.
Jim: [seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight: [mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Dwight: [again] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: What is it?
Dwight: [in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
Jo: I want to talk to Dwight Schrute for a second. I want to ask him a question. [Gabe gets up to leave] If he isn't here in sixty seconds...
Dwight: Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.
Jim: [looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]
Dwight: [whispers] Yeah.
Jim: [looks astonished] Ohhhh!
Gabe: Very unprofessional, 'Jacques.' Or, should I say, Dwight.
Jo: Let's just say I had hired this Jack Souvenir. Then what?
Dwight: I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Jo: All that for this job.
Dwight: Yes.
Jo: That's f***ing crazy. [Jo and Dwight both smile] Get outta here. [Dwight leaves] What a nutjob.
Jim: This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'
Jo: Okay, it's fun to talk about the rejects, but uh, who's got ya excited?
Jim: Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
Jo: Who's this fella? Went to Cornell. What's wrong with him?
Gabe: How much time do you have? Sales ability? None. Integrity? See sales ability. [makes a 'zero' hand gesture]
Jo: And that's your unbiased opinion.
Gabe: Yes, it is.
Jo: So it's not relevant that he took the receptionist away from you?
Gabe: Oh, Jo. Jo, I'm disappointed in you. Some people let personal things into the workpl-. Is she with him? Because I thought that she was...
Jo: Gabe...ugh... you got all close to these people. Got involved in their lives. Let's get you back to Florida. We'll figure out something for you.
Gabe: That sounds like a promotion!
Jo: It's not. Let's get Kelly in here to take his place.
Jim: Um... why Kelly?
Jo: Cause Gabe's tall and weak. She's short and strong. I'm doing an opposites thing.
Jim: Okay.
Jo: How'd my girl Nellie do?
Jim: Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
Jo: She didn't mention it?
Jim: No.
Jo: Integrity move. I like it.
Jim: You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Jo: Well, I'm not saying you must hire her. If you find someone who's clearly a fit, then fine. Just make sure they fit real good. No more manager turnover. Don't mess this up, Jim. And give Dwight an interview. I like a little bit of crazy.
Erin: [hiding under desk, raises a sock puppet up, talking in high-pitched voice] Ahh!
Oscar: Erin, what are you doing?
Erin: I've been turned into a puppet!
Oscar: Okay. [walks away]
Kevin: [giggling, walks to Erin's desk] Look at the puppet! Hi, puppet! Who are you?
Erin: I went to drop off the FedEx forms and an evil witch named Angela turned me into a puppet!
Kevin: [giggles] Yeah. Low blow, puppet.
Erin: And there's only one thing that can change me back into a real girl.
Kevin: It's good. It's just that I wish the puppets would talk more about the alphabet. Not for me... but, if any kids are watching... A, B, and so forth. You know,... M-N-L-O, P... F...
Erin: [as sock puppet] I need the most special thing in the office.
Dwight: Silence?
Erin: A date with the best salesman... Andy Bernard! [Andy walks over to Erin's desk]
Andy: Hey, Erin.
Erin: [gets up] Oh.
Andy: Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?
Erin: [shrugs] I've done it all my life.
Andy: Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.
Andy: Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.
Angela: [loudly] Stanley, I won't be able to invite everyone to the wedding, because we want to keep it to 350.
Stanley: I'll get over it.
Angela: I mean, we just have to see how many Senators and members of Congress want to attend, before we can open it up to regular people. Pam, you know how you and Jim did your ironic wedding? [Pam looks confused] Do you still have the plans for the dream wedding that you couldn't afford?
Pam: That was our dream wedding.
Angela: Niagara Falls? Pregnant? That was your dream? Pork medallions?
Pam: [looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.
Angela: Hmm.
Jim: All right. Name.
Dwight: Dwight Schrute.
Jim: Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.
Dwight: You have to interview me...
Jim: I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Dwight: I demand more questions!
Jim: [ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
Dwight: Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
Jim: Yes.
Dwight: What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Jim: Thank you, Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]
Jim: Well, that was quick.
Kelly: [sighs] Very, very interesting. And you know what? I'm impressed.
Jim: He's not a real candidate.
Kelly: I don't know, Jim, 'cause, makes me think about something my grandfather used to say, which is that, sometimes, the hand that jumps out of the grave and grabs you around the throat; that is the hand that you want on the wheel.
Jim: You took the deal.
Kelly: Yeah, it was a great deal.
Jim: That's not okay.
Kelly: I don't know. Dwight seems like a great leader to me, and I look forward to the personal perks that he promised me privately. What do you think, Toby?
Toby: Well, we could try him out for a little while... [Jim drops his pen, looks exasperated] and if it doesn't work out, you know, maybe one of us could, you know, step in...
Jim: What is happening right now?
Phyllis: Is it true that you're making Dwight the manager?
Jim: No, why would you think that?
Phyllis: He and Kelly said, then they pre-fired me.
Jim: Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
Kelly: That is correct. Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.
Jim: No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Dwight: Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
Jim: Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
Andy: Tuna... You're completely sane.
Jim: Thank you.
Andy: Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?
Jim: Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Kevin: Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?
Jim: [while sighing] I suppose I am.
Kevin: Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...
Oscar: I don't think he meant, that--
Kevin: So now anyone gets to talk at any times?
Oscar: Go ahead.
Kevin: What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]
Oscar: Can I say...?
Jim: Yes.
Oscar: I think it should be Darryl.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Oscar: Kelly's on your side.
Kelly: I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.
Andy: Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.
Ryan: I want an outsider.
Jim: Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
Ryan: No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.
Pam: A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.
Ryan: No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.
Pam: No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.
Ryan: Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?
Ryan: I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led.
Meredith: I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.
Jim: Hey! Hey! Hey!
Meredith: Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]
Andy: She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.
Gabe: [walks in] Gotta catch a plane.
Pam: Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.
Gabe: Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.
Kelly: You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.
Gabe: Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.
Kelly: I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!
Gabe: There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.
Kevin: Later, man.
All: [various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job.
Ryan: Take care, man.
Dwight: We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]
Andy: [stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.
Erin: I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...
Phyllis: Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]
Phyllis: No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]
Jim: What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?
Angela: Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-
Toby: No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]
Kevin: Exactly.
Darryl: [enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.
Jada: Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?
Darryl: [sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.
Jada: I don't know if he'd be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he's a really great dad!
Darryl: Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]
Phyllis: It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?
Jim: What? No, no, it's not a vote.
Phyllis: Then what was this all about?
Jim: I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
Kelly: I don't care. They can just vote.
Jim: No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]
Andy: Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.
Nellie: This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend.
Darryl: Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am.
Fred: No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of... [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration.
Merv: Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today.
Robert: [chuckles] I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response.
Finger Lakes Guy: [geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes.
Dwight: I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]
Creed: You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.
Pam: [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?
Creed: I think you two should meet.
Pam: Well, okay!
Creed: Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]
Pam as fourth-biggest client: [in a comedic male voice] Hello!
Pam as ninth-biggest client: [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!
Pam as fourth-biggest client: Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]
Pam as ninth-biggest client: Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!
Pam as fourth-biggest client: Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!
Creed: It's Kismet!
Pam: Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?
Jim: Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.
Phyllis: Oh, because your jokes are all hilarious.
Pam: It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.
Jim: Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Pam: Yeah he does.
Oscar: Pam, hit the brakes. Stanley does not have a moustache. I misspoke. I'm not sure. I think he has one, now that- I think he has a moustache.
Pam: Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?
Phyllis: Oh, I don't know. Now I think he doesn't.
Pam: Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!
Jim: Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
Angela: Cause we come here to do our jobs. We don't stick our noses in other people's business.
Pam: Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]
Dwight: Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
Gabe: [bell dings] Guys, that's the elevator. What if it's him?
Jim: Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]
Dwight: Yep.
Jim: Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]
Gabe: [reveals Stanley's moustache] Ah! Ha ha ha!
Phyllis: He does have a moustache.
Dwight: Yes!
Pam: Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]
Robert: Good morning, Robert,' says no one because our receptionist is in Florida. [no one responds] Pam!
Pam: Oh! [takes out earbuds]
Robert: Is this a video conference you're having with 'Drake, featuring Swizz Beatz'?
Pam: Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.
Robert: People, you should come to work already warm. Nine to ten a.m. is the most productive potential that a human being-
Nellie: Sorry, sorry, everyone, I'm late! But you all are here, so no harm done at all by my lateness.
Robert: [laughing] Nellie, really, nine fifty?
Nellie: Oh, here's what happened. Seven forty-six, my alarm clock goes off. I hear it. Whack the snooze.
Robert: Ah.
Nellie: Nine minutes. Bzz! Off it goes again. Whack! Seven more times I did that. Bzz, whack. Bzz, whack! By the time I got up, it was ten minutes ago. No willpower. That is my curse!
Robert: [laughs] I've never believed willpower was very important in a woman.
Nellie: Ah ha!
Robert: I don't think you would have shown up to work nearly an hour late for no reason.
Nellie: Oh, I assure you, I would have done. I did, and I will keep doing it.
Robert: No, no, no, no. There's something going on. Some stress in your life.
Nellie: Well, yes, uh... there is the whole moving to Scranton nonsense. Thirty boxes arrived yesterday from England and two trunks from Florida. Then I have to move in to my apartment in this dreadful, God knows where it is backwater suburb of a suburb, and I mean, no offense but are there a lot of Irish people living around here?
Kevin & Meredith: [in unison] Yes.
Nellie: Ugh! I hate that! No offense.
Kevin: None taken.
Oscar: Actually, Nellie, this monologue you're delivering is very offensive.
Nellie: oh! Ay, carumba! The natives are getting restless!
Stanley: Who's a native?
Nellie: Uh, excuse me, the tone here is getting quite hostile. I would appreciate it if you would keep that stuff on the basketball court. [everyone groans]
Oscar: What does that mean?
Dwight: Okay, okay.
Nellie: If you'd let me finish- Or the squash court, or the Supreme Court. Hmm?
Robert: Nellie?
Nellie: Yes, Robert!
Robert: You're clearly under a lot of... stress with the moving and the work situation you've found yourself in.
Nellie: Yeah.
Robert: Let's help her out, shall we? Go above and beyond today to show her some of that warm Scranton hospitality. Jim. Dwight. Take the day. Help Nellie move those boxes into her new place.
Dwight: Why Jim?
Robert: The rest of you, let's throw a party at the end of the day to welcome the newest member of our little community.
Pam: I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?
Jim: I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.
Pam: I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.
Jim: Why is she here?
Andy: [sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.
Erin: [sings] Going to Pennsylvania.
Andy: On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.
Erin: Oh. That must be nice.
Andy: Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.
Erin: Oh, no, no, I meant that it must be nice to have parents.
Andy: Oh. Hmm.
Andy: [sings] Time to have a little kiss!
Erin: No.
Andy: Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.
Erin: Yes.
Andy: I believe in that.
Erin: Yes. So do I.
Andy: I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.
Erin: Important.
Andy: Mm-hmm.
Phyllis: I can't believe he's making us throw a party for her.
Pam: I know, right?
Oscar: She's always late, she's always rude...
Phyllis: It kinda makes me want to throw a really bad party.
Oscar: Yeah.
Phyllis: On purpose.
Pam: Phyllis!
Angela: [laughs] We should do it right here in the break room. [they giggle]
Phyllis: Order carrot cake. [laughter]
Andy: ...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.
Erin: Well, Andy, I'm upset, but you did this in the best way possible, and I knew you as a lover and I'll remember you as a gentleman. Okay, that was one minute and ten seconds.
Andy: Consider it nailed.
Erin: [vocalizing]  I think we should try again. This time, worst case scenario.
Andy: Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-
Erin: [whining] What?
Andy: I just need you to know-
Erin: What is it? I didn't sleep well last night. [they laugh]
Dwight: [lifting box] Ugh! Ow.
Jim: Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
Dwight: Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'
Jim: That was one time-
Dwight: I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Nellie: Oh, no. Really? Magic? No, no, no. Let's not go there. No, nothing is more repellant than magicians. Bunch of grown men waving wands, pulling bunnies out of body crevices. Magicians are repulsive. Next topic.
Jim: [cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.
Pam: Hey, what's up?
Jim: Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
Dwight: [shouting] Haulin' cube!
Jim: That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Pam: So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.
Jim: Sounds like every other party.
Pam: No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.
Jim: Oh! Hire a magician.
Pam: What?
Jim: Trust me.
Pam: [laughs] Okay.
Andy: Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.
Lauren: [knocks on car window] Andy! Hey, what are you doing here?
Andy: Hey, Lauren. Look at you.
Lauren: Well, I know. Look at me.
Andy: I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.
Lauren: Aww! [clicks tongue]
Andy: Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.
Lauren: Oh. God.
Erin: So, I'm Erin. Hi.
Andy: Yep. This is Erin.
Lauren: Nice to meet you. [Erin gasps at another girl outside her window] Well, Jess went out for a run but she'll be back soon. Hey ladies, Andy's here!
Erin: Okay Andy, that is a bachelorette party, this is Jessica's friends and they've been drinking during the daytime. Should we go?
Andy: Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-
Lauren: Oh, Jess! [claps] Look who stopped by after his business trip!
Jessica: Andy! Hey!
Dwight: I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.
Jim: Yes, you should.
Dwight: [finds shoe box] Ooh.
Jim: [reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'
Dwight: I have to see these shoes.
Jim: I doubt that they're sh-
Dwight: Oh!
Jim: Whoa. Who is this guy?
Dwight: Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
Jim: Boyfriend.
Dwight: Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
Jim: Like a boyfriend?
Dwight: You read my mind.
Jim: Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Dwight: Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
Jim: Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Nellie: [walks in] Oh.
Jim: Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Nellie: I see you've discovered Benjamin. That's what I call my box full of photos of Henry.
Dwight: Why not call...
Jim: Shh!
Nellie: God. We owned this flat together. Then one morning, just like that, he was gone. He ran off with the waitress at our favorite restaurant.
Dwight: That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
Jim: Dwight!
Nellie: I couldn't afford the flat myself. So I sold it at a loss. Ah, but what's ten years of bliss down the drain  compared with the thrill of starting over with nothing and no one?
Jim: I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
Dwight: If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
Nellie: Thank you. No. Look, Jim, Dwight, please, don't tell anyone about this.
Jim: No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
Nellie: God, no. That's the most embarrassing thing of all this. What kind of fool gets her heart broken by bloody stage magician?
Jim: [in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.
Pam: What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.
Jim: No, that's not what I-
Nellie: Jim, could you give us a hand?
Jim: Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
Pam: Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]
Angela: Pam, we have a great idea.
Oscar: Listen to this.
Angela: We're going to have the fluorescent lights flickering. It's gonna make everyone sick.
Pam: Or what if...
Angela: Okay.
Pam: We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.
Angela: I knew she'd crack! I wanted to leave you out, you know.
Oscar: We're in far too deep. We can't change course at this point.
Pam: What are you talking about? Yes we can.
Oscar: What I mean to say is we don't want to.
Phyllis: Toots, we're not stopping this train, so get off the tracks.
Lauren: [pops balloon] Suck it! [cheers, applause]
Erin: Andy-
Andy: It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?
Erin: No, uh, I'll just have some gummy bears.
Andy: These are delicious.
Erin: But... they're penises.
Lauren: And we come to Matthew. The guy who was with his old girlfriend basically the whole time we were together. [party guests groan]
Andy: Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.
Party guests: No, pop it. Pop it! [Lauren pops the balloon, party guests cheer]
Jessica: Hey.
Andy: Hey.
Jessica: Sorry. It's kind of a madhouse.
Megan: [grabs Andy] Ahh!
Andy: Oh! Ah, Megan.
Megan: You are one of the good ones, nard dog.
Andy: Aww.
Megan: No, really. [to Jessica] Where's my Andy?
Jessica: I dunno.
Andy: Oh, he's out there.
Megan: Aww. Are you going to sing for us?
Andy: Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...
Megan: That's not like you. That's not like you. Come on, sing! Sing!
Andy: [singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...
Pam: Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]
Darryl: Oh, in the warehouse we use code names for people we want to talk about. Andy was Jelly Roll. Mike was Dennis the Menace. Ryan was douche bag.
Ryan: Hey, that's not a code name. That's just an insult.
Oscar: Plus everyone would know who you meant.
Ryan: Yeah!
Pam: No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?
Angela: Nobody's named Monday.
Ryan: Hey, how about we go with Pam? Simple, easy to remember.
Pam: Cause there's someone already here named Pam.
Kevin: Shh, here she comes!
All: Hey!
Phyllis: Welcome to your party.
Creed: Everybody get comfy now. This first song's over a half hour long. [plays off-tune notes]
Creed: Best gig ever. They asked me to play only originals. I said, 'Have you heard my originals? They're terrible.' They said, 'Even better.' I said, 'I get it. It's an ironic party for Nellie.'
Erin: Maybe we should just go.
Andy: No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?
Jessica: Uh, yeah, sure. What's up?
Andy: Uh, maybe we could talk in private?
Jessica: Uh, yeah. What is it?
Andy: Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.
Jessica: You're breaking up with me?
Andy: Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.
Jessica: Oh my God. Are you leaving me for Erin? You said she wasn't relationship material and she wasn't as good as me, but it's her, isn't it?
Andy: Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.
Jessica: What?
Andy: I am gay, and I prefer men.
Kenny: I knew it!
Andy: You did not, Kenny!
Kenny: You invited me to go shopping with you.
Andy: I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.
Jessica: Andy, you're not gay. I mean, we were... together. And you seemed pretty excitable.
Andy: Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.
Jessica: I can't say it doesn't make sense...
Andy: Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-
Jessica: Look, it's fine, Andy. I didn't think we were gonna get married or anything. I just... I'm just upset for now.
Andy: Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.
Robert: This humble but sincere effort is all for our valued new colleague. Excellent.
Oscar: To Nellie Bertram, you are a most welcome and friendly presence at our company.
Robert: Cheers.
Nellie: Why thank you.
Oscar: Pam, on the other hand, is a most unwelcome, entitled, unfriendly presence in our company.
All: Cheers.
Angela: Nellie is terrific, but to be honest, every day I imagine how happy I'd be if Pam died. [laughter]
Jim: Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Creed: We hate Pam. We hate Pam.
All: We hate Pam! We hate Pam!
Magician: So we've established-
Jim: No. No.
Magician: -that you guys hate Pam. Do you ever wish she would just... disappear? [sets off flash paper]
Pam: Oh! [laughter, murmuring]
Erin: That was a really rough scene.
Andy: Right? Rough scene.
Erin: Yeah.
Andy: Oh... at least we can kiss now.
Erin: Oh, yeah. [gives him a quick kiss]
Andy: You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.
Erin: Yeah. Yes, of course. Ah... I feel really tired.
Andy: Yeah.
Erin: Probably from seeing that turkey.
Andy: Oh yeah.
Erin: When we drove by the farm. Oh. Always does it.
Magician: Are you Nellie? Oh, I think you're my volunteer. Come on over here, huh?
Jim: Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
Robert: no, Nellie, she-
Jim: I'll do it.
Magician: Oh! Big guy, huh? How's the air up there? Watch out for... birds. [chuckles] All right, let's uh- let's do some card magic. Now, what I want you to do is... I want you to pick a card just by looking at it. Do not say what it is.
Jim: [picks a card] It's the four of hearts.
Robert: Oh, no, you-
Magician: Looks like we got a guy from another country here, huh? No hablo el cardo, senor? Hmm? Ha. All right, the card is picked. Now sir, will you please shuffled the deck? [Jim drops the cards] You didn't just do that on purpose, did ya?
Robert: [to Dwight] Why is Jim treating the magician poorly?
Magician: Little known fact about me. Before I was a magician, I used to work at a rope factory.
Jim: Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
Magician: But I never could seem to figure out those knots.
Pam: That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.
Magician: [yells] What the hell? All right, where's Phyllis? Who's Phyllis? Look. This is really uncool, okay? I put on a clean show here-
Dwight: Okay scram, wizard.
Magician: What?
Dwight: You heard me!
Magician: Huh!
Robert: Well Nellie, I'm sorry. If I'd known Jim and Pam would use this party as an excuse to abuse a magician-
Nellie: Well, I thought it was quite fun. In fact, I think they're brilliant employees, in their own way. Don't you see what I see?
Robert: Interesting. Yes. No, yes, I see that. Great work, team. Great party.
Kevin: You think this is a great party? This cake has vegetables in it. Like a salad bar, Robert. How do I get this taste out of my mouth?
Erin: What? Why are we-
Andy: I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]
Megan: Oh. Hello. Hey everybody, look who's here.
Jessica: What are you doing here?
Andy: Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.
Megan: Why the hell did you come back here?
Jessica: Go away.
Kenny: Get lost!
Woman: Get out!
Andy: Okay.
Lauren: You're done!
Andy: Bye guys.
Lauren: Get out! You ruined my party! Who does that? Are you kidding me? [Andy and Erin run to the car] Yeah, run away!
Kenny: You're disgusting!
Lauren: I can't believe you're not gay! [Andy and Erin kiss]
Kenny: Yeah get out of here.
Various: Don't come back. [someone throws food at the car]
Erin: Uh-oh! [laughs, they drive away]
Various: You don't even know how to drive! Bye Andy! Loser! Nice car!
Pam: Hey Hank.
Hank: Yes ma'am.
Pam: I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.
Hank: Yes ma'am. I got my eyes open.
Jim: Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
Hank: What? That ain't right.
Pam: Yeah, he came and went.
Hank: Wait a minute! You said it was a magician, right? [Pam nods] You don't think he could've used... it couldn't have been...
Pam: Let's just- let's go.
Jim: Night-night.
Phyllis: Whoo! Wow, it is raining cats and dogs out there. Holy moley.
Jim: Phyllis says the same twelve clichs every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.
Darryl: So how was the drive in?
Phyllis: Oh, nobody knows how to drive in the rain.
Darryl: You don't say?
Phyllis: Yeah. You know the roads are actually the slickest in the first half hour?
Phyllis: Oh, the plants are gonna love this.
Oscar: Yeah.
Phyllis: I actually sleep better when it's raining.
Meredith: Tell me about it.
Oscar: Time's almost up. How many are left?
Pam: Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'
Darryl: Phyllis. This rain... does it make you wanna be doing something?
Phyllis: What do you mean?
Pam: You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?
Jim: Hey, come on.
Phyllis: Lots of things are cozy in the rain.
Jim: And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan]
Phyllis: I mean, normally the rain would make me want to stay home, curled up with a good book. But everybody's being so nice to me today.  I'm really happy being here.
Andy: [singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
Andy & Erin: Hey la, hey la...
Andy: ...my girlfriend's back!
Erin: [simultaneously] ...his girlfriend's back! [others cheer and applaud]
Andy: Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
Kevin: Welcome home.
Erin: Thank you.
Andy: Hey, Kev.
Kevin: Yeah.
Andy: Nice sweater.
Kevin: [wearing a Cornell sweater] Thank you. Nellie was nice enough to give it to me. She's sweet. I just wish there was pockets.
Andy: What happened to old salty?
Dwight: Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Dwight: I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.
Andy: Okey dokey. [knocks on door]
Nellie: Yes?
Andy: Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.
Nellie: Oh yes.
Andy: I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.
Nellie: You are most welcome.
Andy: Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.
Nellie: No.
Andy: Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.
Nellie: Mm-hmm.
Andy: Get back to normalcy.
Nellie: Hmm, no.
Ravi: ...and then just lay him in his crib, and then bicycle his legs. And then after Jim quiets down, you do the same thing with your baby. [Pam, Jim and Kelly laugh] But if he keeps having problems, just give me a call.
Pam: Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.
Jim: That's it.
Kelly: It's no bother, you guys are our friends.
Pam: Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.
Jim: Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Pam: Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.
Pam: [talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.
Kelly: [cries, slams fist on desk] Why?
Pam: [Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.
Kevin: [Ryan and Kelly make out on Oscar's desk] Get lower.
Ryan: Um, also, little tip, never shake the baby.
Jim: Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
Ryan: Don't shake the baby. Um, a lot of times, parents get frustrated 'cause the baby's crying and they shake the baby. And you got to, um, you can't do that.
Pam: Don't shake our baby?
Ryan: Yeah.
Pam: Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.
Ryan: Oh, my God.
Pam: Yeah, I'm glad you said something.
Ryan: Me too.
Ryan: Kelly and I broke up and she can do whatever she wants. And her new boyfriend seems awesome, if you're into Indian people. I'm not.
Ryan: Hey, um, what's the deal with this guy? He's really into Kelly, huh?
Pam: Yeah, they're really great together.
Ryan: Maybe we weren't right together, but... it's weird. I'd rather she be alone than with somebody. Is that love?
Jim: That's about it, yeah.
Robert: Nellie! You've been terrific in your interim capacity. But, Andrew is the rightful manager so if you would just give him his office-
Nellie: No.
Robert: I'm sorry?
Andy: This is what I was trying to tell you.
Robert: I'm not accustomed to people saying no to me. [laughs]
Nellie: Well, Bobby, get accustomed to it because then it feels so good when they finally say yes.
Robert: You're both adults. I'm sure you can figure this out between yourselves.
Robert: I never allow sexual desire to influence a business decision. So I find it best to excuse myself temporarily until I've had a chance to make love and then go back and analyze the situation rationally. Buffett operates the same way.
Nellie: I'm gonna count down from five and if you are not out of my office, I'm going to dock your pay one hundred dollars.
Andy: [chuckling] Okay.
Nellie: Five... four...
Andy: You can't dock my pay-
Nellie: Angela! Dock Andy's pay one hundred dollars.
Angela: On it!
Andy: Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?
Nellie: Do you want to go again?
Andy: Angela?
Nellie: Let's go again. Five... four...
Andy: Ooh, she's counting again.
Nellie: Three... two... one...
Andy: Oh, oh!
Nellie: Angela, two hundred dollars!
Angela: You got it.
Andy: Seriously, Angela?
Andy: I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.
Erin: When I see him start to get mad, I just put my hand on his arm like this.
Nellie: I know what, let's go... ten thousand dollars! [Andy laughs] Five... four...
Andy: You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.
Nellie: Three...
Andy: It's literally like-
Nellie: Two... [Andy runs out of the room] one.
Erin: There you go. [helps Andy in the car] Hey. we're gonna have a nice, hot date.
Erin: Hey. So last night was so not a big deal.
Andy: Oh, yeah, I was just tired.
Erin: We both were. Plus, I was definitely not my normal sexy self.
Andy: Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.
Erin: Really. It's not a big deal.
Andy: Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.
Ryan: I found this the other day while I was journaling and they reminded me of you.
Kelly: Oh, those are from our weekend at the time share.
Ryan: Yeah, the fractional ownership property. [sigh] Oh, we took this one right before we got in that huge fight.
Kelly: God I don't even remember what that fight was about.
Ryan: You were being really bratty about where we would go out to dinner. But all I remember is how pretty you looked, taking those pictures of me. Anyway, if you want to order prints of your own, I can send you the link.
Ryan: I'm in love with Kelly Kapoor. And I don't know how I'm gonna feel tomorrow or the next day or the day after that, but I do know that right here, right now, all I can think about is spending the rest of my life with her. Again, that could change.
Erin: When you lost the manager job-
Dwight: Yes?
Erin: Did it affect you outside of the office?
Dwight: How?
Erin: I don't know what the technical term is... Penial softiosis?
Dwight: Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Erin: Oh, okay.
Dwight: Okay?
Erin: Okay.
Dwight: Washington Monument.
Erin: Oh.
Dwight: Eiffel Tower.
Erin: Okay, okay.
Pam: I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.
Kelly: He's so sweet. He pointed to my latte and he said, 'Kelly, that will be the color of our children.'
Pam: Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?
Kelly: Which time?
Pam: I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.
Dwight: One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.
Dwight: Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.
Dwight: Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.
Nellie: What do you mean?
Dwight: Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
Nellie: I just wanted to take the man's job, not his manhood.
Nellie: Okay, I would like to invite everyone into the conference room.
Andy: You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.
Nellie: Okay, if you would like to take a seat we can get started.
Andy: Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.
Nellie: No.
Andy: Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.
Robert: Andrew, not everyone here is important. And the word is 'impotence.'
Nellie: Which is important in its own way. So if you'd just like to take a seat, Andy.
Nellie: Take a man's job, but leave him his balls.' Margaret Thatcher said that... probably. Don't know. Don't read. Didn't see the movie.
Nellie: This meeting is not about any one person in particular. It is a human problem.
Dwight: It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
Oscar: Nellie, does the person affected by this want us to help her in any way in particular?
Nellie: Oh, oh, it's not me. No, no. I've never had any problem in that arena. And I have been with several older men.
Robert & Creed: [in unison] How old?
Creed: Jinx. Buy me some Coke.
Nellie: Dwight told me about it earlier.
Erin: Dwight!
All: What?
Erin: You promised!
Kevin: Dwight couldn't get it up for Nellie?
Dwight: No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]
Angela: What are you doing?
Oscar: What is this?
Angela: Stop that! Dwight! Stop that, stop it.
Andy: Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?
Andy: I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.
Andy: Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?
Jim: Um...
Darryl: Uh... I have other issues. I'm terrible at math. Overweight. You- you're in great shape. A lot better shape than I am, tell you what.
Robert: It seems Andy is the only one with this problem. Fascinating.
Andy: Fascinating.
Gabe: I don't really see what the problem is. Erin doesn't even like sex, remember? You said it feels like getting tackled by a skeleton.
Nellie: Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any problems with Little Chumbo?
Kevin: Tip-top shape.
Nellie: Oh... Stanley?
Stanley: No. Um-um.
Nellie: Creed, you are a thousand years old.
Creed: Haven't heard any complaints. Wouldn't care if I did.
Andy: Okay, so I-
Pam: Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.
Jim: What happened?
Pam: That a couple of times-
Jim: Couple of times.
Robert: Jim, maybe you could tell us about one of those times.
Dwight: Yeah Jim.
Andy: Yeah Jim, get it out there.
Jim: Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Pam: Okay, stop.
Jim: I was very drunk.
Phyllis: If it makes you feel any better, I never had an orgasm until I was forty-two. And then when I did, it lasted 'til I was forty-four.
Phyllis: Forty-three was ju- I got nothing done. [laughs]
Gabe: I've read- and I don't know anything about this personally- but they say prostate stimulation can help.
Angela: Ugh.
Gabe: This is just, uh- This American Life, I think I heard it on.
Robert: No, that's absolutely the case.
Gabe: I know, right?
Dwight: You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Robert: Andy, why don't you tell us about the best erection of your life? Or does anyone else have any remarkable erections they'd like to share? [Creed, Kevin and Meredith raise their hands]
Kevin: Ooh, ooh!
Jim: Wow, what are we talking about?
Erin: Toby, doesn't HR have some rules against talking about this kind of stuff?
Toby: Erin, HR is a joke. I can't do anything about anything.
Nellie: The most important thing to remember is not to stress about this. Stress just makes it worse, and then you stress more. And that's a vicious spiral.
Robert: I almost didn't come in today. [laughs]
Andy: [on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.
Nellie: Erin, on phone memos you're writing the date American style. Month, day, year. I prefer it day, month, year. Small, bigger, biggest. Oh, sexual innuendo. Not intentional.
Erin: Shut up. Shut up! I am sick of your dumb opinions. And if you don't like the way that I take phone messages, here! [throws phone] Take 'em yourself!
Andy: Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!
Erin: And Andy is the manager, not Nellie!
Andy: Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!
Nellie: Okay, just calm down.
Andy: You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.
Robert: Andy, why don't you just take a seat?
Andy: Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]
Erin: And why don't you take all your stupid memos and your stupid pens and your dumb caramels?
Andy: And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!
Darryl: He does not like that wall.
Erin: Maybe we'll get sent to anger management together.
Andy: That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.
Robert: Andy, Erin, you can join us now.
Ryan: Hey, I hear you been bad-mouthing me to Kelly.
Pam: All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.
Ryan: Well that's your opinion and it's her opinion, but it's not my opinion. If you have something bad to say to me, Pam, say it to my face.
Pam: Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.
Ryan: Well a lot of people would say that I'm a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.
Oscar: Oh come on, Ryan. Really? Ravi's way better.
Ryan: For Kelly?
Kevin: Yeah. Man, you're insane right now. Ravi's the whole package.
Nate: I've never met Ravi personally, but I'm gonna go ahead and say, just having knowing you a short while, Brian, that I prefer Ravi. And again, I've never even met the guy.
Ryan: Kelly, I wrote you the most amazing love poem. But I can't even read it. My heart couldn't handle it.
Pam: Oh, no, no, no.
Oscar: Oh, come on.
Pam: Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.
Ryan: No. It would cause me too much pain.
Pam: Read through the pain. Be strong.
Ryan: This poem would crush you!
Oscar: Ryan, go away! She found herself a beautiful boyfriend!
Kevin: Yeah, man, he's absolutely gorgeous! Please leave her alone.
Ryan: You see, Kelly? Our love scares them. It screws up their cookie-cutter world.
Kelly: Ravi makes me incredibly happy. And Ryan puts me through so much drama. So I guess I just have to decide which of those is more important to me.
Robert: Andy, we're going to go with Nellie as manager and put you back on the sales team. I promise you, in time, we'll all laugh about this incident. I already think it's kind of funny. [chuckles]
Andy: No.
Robert: Excuse me?
Andy: I'm saying no.
Robert: Well you can't say no.
Andy: No.
Pam: [sees Ryan on the horse] Oh, boo! Boo! Boo to you! Boo!
Ryan: You are toxic! You are toxic!
Pam: Boo!
Jim: Hey, hey. Okay.
Ryan: Kelly, I have a few things to say to you, so please don't interrupt.
Kelly: I wasn't going to interrupt.
Ryan: Well you do a lot, so just don't. Thank you. I know that I haven't always treated you the way that you, for whatever reason, feel you deserve to be treated. But I want to marry you, Kelly Kapoor. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday, and probably.
Pam: Barf! Ugh, you suck!
Ryan: What is your problem? [to horse wrangler] Hey, hey, hey, can we turn this back around quickly, please? This is very important to me.
Wrangler: Turn around. Turn around. Turn around!
Ryan: Can we turn this [bleep]-ing thing around? Thank you.
Wrangler: She don't wanna turn around.
Ryan: Thank you. Kelly, I can't promise you that we'll always stay together. I can't promise you that I'll never cheat on you. Nor should I. Modern marriages aren't built that way. Men aren't built that way. There's a very interesting article I can email to you. But I can tell you this. Even if the odds are fifty-fifty that we'll break up within the week, I wanna roll those dice. I love you, Kelly.
Kelly: Ryan.
Ryan: Will you roll those dice with me?
Kelly: You mean so much to me. But, I love Ravi and I choose him.
Ryan: No you don't.
Kelly: I do.
Ryan: No you don't.
Kelly: I hope we can still be friends. Can I have a hug?
Ryan: What? [they hug]
Kelly: That was really cool. [they make out]
Angela: Ugh. Eww!
Jim: Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
Angela: Oh God!
Robert: Look, Andrew, we can discuss the specifics of the job.
Andy: No.
Nellie: It's the apology. I really have to insist.
Andy: [British accent] No.
Nellie: Stop saying no.
Andy: No.
Robert: Andrew, if you say no one more time, you're fired. So... is there anything else you wanna say?
Andy: No.
Andy: I can't describe it. I just, for the first time in a long time, I actually feel in control. I feel... alive.
Erin: Here- [grabs the box Andy's holding]
Andy: Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.
Erin: But you hurt your hand.
Andy: I... Got... It.
Erin: Right now?
Andy: Yes.
Pam: You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?
Jim: Not at all, can we go?
Pam: Kapoor and ka-desperate, he watches.'
Jim: Second line.
Pam: He is a drifter out to sea.'
Jim: And when the Indian Ocean calms, one speck of white remains in waters cold and Kelly green.'
Pam: It's just so dumb. [chokes up] But when he describes himself as a child, lost on the life raft...
Jim: Uh, Ryan can never know.
Ryan: [pacing back and forth.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no.
Pam: Okay fine. Ryan, something the matter?
Ryan: Smokey's dead.
Pam: Smokey, the bear?
Ryan: Smokey Robinson Pam. He died like an hour ago, I guess I'm the first to know.
Jim: Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
Ryan: Oh you liked him? That's nice. Did you like when he changed the course of American music like two or three times? Did you like that tracks of my tears is maybe the last true love song ever written? I'm glad you liked him Jim. I am completely devastated right now.
Jim: Well, I second that emotion.
Ryan: Huh?
Nellie: I know a few of his songs, but what were his big ones?
Ryan: Oh God, Nellie! What wasn't his? I mean, um, 'Tracks of my Tears'?
Nellie: Yeah
Ryan: Um... God, so many, Nellie!
Pam: No, no, no, 'Tracks of My Tears' and what else? What are some more? What's one more?
Ryan: Okay, I'm not... I'm not playing this game, Pam. Not today.
Pam: I don't think you love Smokey Robinson. I think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
Ryan: Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a fan of Jason Mraz or the Beatles.
Dwight: You don't like the Beatles?
Ryan: That's... That's not the point!
Dwight: Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
Ryan: Okay, you know, you always think you have time to see these legends before they go. What was I so busy doing?
Oscar: It says here this Smokey Robinson dead thing was a hoax. It's on CNN as of two minutes ago.
Ryan: Okay well, that's a relief!
Jim: Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Pam: Oh my God, Ryan! That's perfect! You have to go!
Jim: Tickets are 250 bucks.
Pam: 250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest Smokey Robinson fan.
Ryan: Yeah... Who's opening?
Jim: Paul Anka.
Ryan: Paul Anka?! How can they make the Smoke Man play with someone like that? I don't think I can see this.
Jim: Okay, you could just show up late though.
Ryan: How much is parking, like 30 bucks? That's not what Smokey would have wanted. Does want.
Pam: Tears of a clown!
Ryan: Don't call me a clown, Pam. You're better than that!
Darryl: Looking good, RC!
Robert: Ugh, I hate ties! I feel like I'm being strangled like I'm at some erotic asphyxiation sex club over on I-84. The red room say? Or Dominick's?
Angela: Robert! The senator was going to wear dark brown tonight... I'm sure it will be fine.
Angela: My husband is sponsoring a fundraiser tonight for local dog shelters! Robert California bought two tables for everyone here! These people were lucky to get seats because it is going to be a who's who of the northern 22nd district!
Dwight: I don't want to alarm people, but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
Jim: Well, as long as you don't want to alarm people...
Oscar: What's going on?
Dwight: There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
Erin: Oh that's Andy. He's just hanging out
Dwight: That's how workplace tragedies always begin. A middle aged white male 'hanging out'. Call the cops!
Pam: Dwight, I don't think he's going to hurt anybody.
Phyllis: How do you? I mean, why do you think he's there?
Dwight: I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof. [Grabs bag.] And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
Nellie: I knew this would happen! Everybody told me if I moved to America, I'd be murdered.
Andy: Hey!
Erin: Hey, just wanted to say hi and hear you say everything is normal. Maybe video tape you saying that so that everyone upstairs can see.
Angela: We think you might kill Robert.
Andy: What?
Kevin: because he fired you which means apparently you're living in your car now.
Andy: guys, everything is fine! I'm just here to pick up Erin. We're going to the Fundraiser.
Pam: Oh, great! That sounds good!
Kevin: Wait, what? You're going to the fundraiser tonight? That's going to be weird.
Andy: Why would that be weird?
Kevin: It's going to be super weird, he just fired you last week.
Erin: Andy's just coming as my date.
Kevin: Hey, I hear you! I hope you're right. It just seems like it's going to be really, really weird.
Nellie: [hears knocks on door.] Come in!
Darryl: You really re-did Andy's office, huh?
Nellie: Yes, cut out the clutter. Very simple, very minimal.
Darryl: I need you to sign these, we got a shipment going out.
Nellie: How are things in the warehouse?
Darryl: You could go downstairs and ask them?
Nellie: The warehouse isn't downstairs? [laughs.] Is it? Is it?
Darryl: Who knew, right?
Nellie: [speechless.] I...
Nellie: Tonight could be the night that Darryl and I go from casual work friends to actual good friends. The only thing standing in our way is the contempt he seems to feel for me.
Angela: Robert, the senator and I wanted to stop by and say hello.
Andy: Hello! Did anyone order a blast from the past, with a side order of sexy?
Kevin: Oh man, this is weird!
Robert: Andrew. [Robert extends his hand.]
Andy: Oh, Wanna shake my hand, huh? Cause I want to shake your body! [hugs Robert and laughs.] I had you, I had you!
Andy: [points back and forth at the multiple cameras] Where do I look? It's been so long since I did one of these things? Okay, alright! What's the question? How am I doing? Umm... Great!
Kevin: Creed, I just bid twenty dollars on six Jiu-Jitsu lessons. No one's raping this guy!
Creed: Well, I don't want to get raped [picks up clipboard] Twenty-Two!
Kevin: No! It was my idea to not be raped!
Dwight: [Dwight enters] Wait, you think Jiu-Jitsu classes cost $22 [grabs clipboard.] If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Kevin: Whoa, Dwight, I don't think you understand.
Dwight: You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
Kevin: So Dwight doesn't understand silent auctions. I guess he's the stupid guy in the office, huh? Up till now, we didn't have one!
Andy: What haven't I been doing? Gosh, just today I was working on this rock opera that I'm writing, though it feels more like I'm receiving it than writing it.
Jim: Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Andy: The hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef. And he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil.
Pam: Sounds like you're doing alright.
Andy: Ehh, a little better than alright, actually. Really good!
Ryan: Oh, this guy is having a breakdown.
Senator: You know, Oscar, I really had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
Oscar: my dog Gerald is my life.
Senator: really? Well, if you want to get involved, call me. This is my cell. I'm more likely to pick up night, say after 9... Excuse me. [Walks away.]
Oscar: This confirms three things: I'm right about the senator, I still got it, and poor Angela.
Robert: [telling story to Nellie.] I stepped in right away and start--
Andy: Bobby! Bobbo! You're a rock opera guy, right? You like rock operas?
Robert: Well...
Andy: You gotta check out this thing I'm working on, it's really cool. There's this character Thomas Oregon, and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control.
Robert: So, Thomas Oregon is an evil figure?
Andy: Evil! [chuckles.] although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants.
Robert: and the hero, who's that based on?
Andy: Me, I guess. [sings.] We're flying so high, we're crackin' the sky! Gonna fly out of this dome my girlfriend and I!
Meredith: Hey jabroni. Show some class.
Stanley: She's right, Andy. you're being a jabroni
Andy: You're being a Thomas Oregon!
Robert: Andrew, I think this may have been a bad idea. Why don't you let me pay for you and Erin to go out to a great romantic dinner tonight?
Andy: Don't need you to pay for me. I'm doing just fine, thank you. Why don't you quit harshing our mellow?
Robert: Andy you should leave. Now.
Andy: [to Waiter.] Excuse me. I would like to purchase two seats at another table, please.
Waiter: I'm sorry, the tables are sold as complete units.
Andy: then I'll take a table!
Waiter: Okay
Andy: And a high five! [Raises hand, misses high five with waiter.] Oh, let's do this again!
Andy: [waiter is cracking pepper into Andys salad] Oh, yes indeed... When! [Waiter begins walking away.] Whoa, whoa, whoa! You forgot a few salads! [waiter peppers another salad.] When!
Oscar: I stumbled into a very dramatic situation. Angelas husband just hit on me!
Pam: Oh my god!
Oscar: I know!
Jim: Wait, what? Come on!
Oscar: We were talking about animals, he gives me his cell phone number. He was just dying for me to have it.
Jim: Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter?
Oscar: Well, if you would have seen the look he gave me, he wanted to run more than just my vote.
Jim: Okay, what was this look? [Oscar does the look.]
Pam: Whoa!
Jim: What happened, did he do it?
Pam: Are you-- Twice! For real?
Jim: Okay guys, not every glance means something, alright? Life isn't Downton Abbey.
Pam: Life is Downton Abbey.
Jim: Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
Dwight: [on phone.] How much do you guys charge for a one full year gym membership? Thank you!
Dwight: It's $475! Like candy from a baby!
Andy: Hey... David Wallace!
David: Andy Bernard!
Andy: Hey, how are you?
David: How you doing, I'm great! How you doing, are you still with Dunder Mifflin?
Andy: No, got canned last week.
David: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
Andy: No, best thing that ever happened to me.
David: That's the attitude to have. You know what, when I got canned, I was lost, right? I poured myself into this ridiculous vacuum for toys called Suck-It.
Andy: Yikes!
David: Yeah, exactly right? Then suddenly out of nowhere, the US military bought the patent from me for twenty million dollars! The point is, forget those guys, k? Move on! Good to see you, Andy!
Nellie: Call me a lame man, but I wish there was some real food here. You know, like hamburgers... Or Oreos... Or a pizza pie or, what's another food that we like?
Darryl: Tacos.
Nellie: What I wouldn't give for a big mess of tacos right now!
Darryl: I can go get us some tacos.
Nellie: Brilliant!
Darryl: If you loan me some money.
Nellie: Yes, I can do that. For, um, for two tacos, we'd probably need about what 20... $20? Or $25? $20?
Darryl: $30.00
Nellie: $30, yes!
Nellie: I've never eaten a taco. I'm not entirely sure what they are. As long as they're not slimy, and please god don't let them have eyes!
Oscar: [Jim shakes Senators hand, returns to table.] So?
Jim: Boom! [hands Oscar a business card.]
Oscar: This is interesting.
Pam: Hm-hmm.
Jim: what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Pam: Or you proved that he thinks you're gay.
Oscar: He does not think Jim's gay. A gay man would not leave the house wearing those shoes.
Pam: Well, a gay man would not leave the store wearing those shoes!
Jim: Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
Speaker: Before we bring out our guest of honor tonight, we are very proud to introduce a great philanthropist and a great guy. Robert California!
Robert: Thank you. Why do we love dogs? Want me to tell you why? There is no answer. Our love for them confounds reason!
Andy: can you believe this guy?
Robert: The state senator, Robert Lipton, loves dogs. he asked me if I loved dogs. you know what I said? Yes! [laughter.]
Andy: Not a joke. That was not even a joke.
Robert: Bella here was a therapy dog for ten years. when her owner passed away she came to this organization for placement. But people don't often adopt older dogs, so Bella and eleven heroes like her are being cared for by our generous volunteers because frankly nobody else will
Andy: I will! I will take all of those dogs!
Robert: Andy, that's very kind--
Andy: No, no, no. This guy can talk and talk all he wants, but it's not that complicated.
Robert: Andy why don't we discuss this at a--
Andy: No, no, no, it's about being there for someone after it's become inconvenient for them to be around. Hello everyone, I am Andy Bernard and I am going to take that bitch home! That is a female dog reference. [Points at himself] This bitch understands loyalty! Sassy human reference [grabs dog] thank you, I will take Bella and every single one of her friends!
Erin: Oh God!
Senator: Mr. Bernard, right this way.
Andy: Okay! Hope you all learned something!
Vet: Huey is going to need this medication once every 90 minutes. You can administer it orally, but he's going to puke it up. So, other end is best. Don't split up Daisy and Mojo because daisy will start to, uh... I was going to say bark, but it's more of a scream.
Andy: I'm so ready to love all of these animals. This one's even bonding with me already.
Vet: Uh, no. Kenny's a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you're in some kind of emotional crisis.
Andy: Stupid dog.
Senator: Well, if you would like to talk about this some more, my office is always open! So here's my office number, and my cell number.
Meredith: Thank you!
Pam: Well, looks like he really did just want to talk about the issues. i'm Sorry Oscar.
Oscar: sorry about what? There's nothing to be sorry about here.
Oscar: No. I'm certainly not disappointed that Angelas husband was not hitting on me. I'd have to be a monster to root for that. A lonely, aging monster.
Darryl: Tacos were on sale, eight for $3!
Nellie: Oh, great! Okay, oh... Oh, these tacos!
Darryl: Hmhmm.
Nellie: Mmm! Uhh [Eats Taco incorrectly.] Mmmm... Oh! Hmmph!
Darryl: She's trying.
Speaker: The winner of the three day trip to the sky top lodge is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Yes! Thank you!
Speaker: The yearlong membership to Scraton-Bikram Yoga is Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Oh yes! Yeah!
Speaker: A one hour appointment with the kissing magician goes to Dwight Schrute!
Dwight: [applause] Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Speaker: Well, I think I can save us some time, Dwight Schrute has won every single item here!
Dwight: Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Speaker: Well, Dwight, yes! You certainly are a record breaker! Your donation is the largest we've ever received at over 34 thousand dollars! [applause]
Jim: Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Dwight: Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you something: when did it become all about the money. when did it become about the flower arrangements, and the white wine spritser, hmm? and all the dinner rolls. you people should be ashamed of yourselves! How many courses did we have tonight, two? Three maybe, if you choose the pudding? I mean what waste! these tables tarted up like Victorian whores! lets' remember we are all here for the dog society. He's what's important, whatever his name is. Not any of this. So that is going to be my donation to you. Thank you and good night! [throws microphone and runs away]
Senator: Oscar!
Oscar: Nice to see you again, it was lovely!
Senator: It was lovely! And don't forget to call.
Oscar: okay
Senator: thanks so much for coming
Oscar: why does this always happen to me? Ahh! I just feel so bad for Angela
Andy: [applying diaper to dog.] so it just goes on under here like this?
Vet: that's right!
Andy: Ugh, oh god!
Vet: Yeah, you never get used to that.
Jim: Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Andy: I am so great!
Erin: He's great. we're all great. Twelve dogs. This my life now, I'm a dog nurse.
Jim: Look at that one though, he's smiling!
Vet: Yeah, he should be! It's his first day without a muzzle.
Andy: This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me
Pam: Absolutely, it's awesome--
Jim: Yes--
Kevin: I'm sorry, are you guys nuts? He's not doing great! He was fired! This is terrible! This is literally the worst thing that has ever happened to you, not the best.
Andy: You're right. he's right, I am a mess. This whole night I've been trying to convince you guys that I'm fine. I guess I thought that if I could convince you that I'm fine, maybe--
Vet: Maybe you would think it too! [silence.] I'm sorry, it's just I don't get to be in a lot of human conversations.
Jim: Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Pam: Yeah, I mean, admitting you need help is the first step!
Andy: Yes! And also, focusing on the positive. Like I got a lot of good things going on!
Jim: Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Andy: Yeah, I do. I have that.
Jim: Yeah
Erin: You're going to be alright
Kevin: No. No he's not.
Andy: Yes, I am! Thank you, Kev!
Kevin: You're welcome!
Kevin: Sometimes I feel like every one I work with is an idiot. and by sometimes I mean all times. All the times. Every of the times!
Erin: So some of us ended up adopting those elderly dogs. It's been great!
Darryl: Pepper's been getting me out of the house, going on runs.
Kevin: My dog Ruby doesn't do anything, she just lays there all day! She's so chill.
Pam: What do you feed her?
Kevin: Well I put out Pro Bow-Wow, but she barely touches it. She's so dainty!
Darryl: Is she sick? How are her poops?
Kevin: Doesn't really poop. It's perfect, nothing to pick up! She just kind of lies there all day like a good girl. I put on the TV for her, but I have to prop her eyes open so she can see it.
Pam: Does she smell?
Kevin: She smells horrible. It's unbelievable. But I don't want to put her in the bath, because I'm afraid that she'll drown.
Kevin: People seem awful interested in you Ruby. Guess they're just jealous, right! [dog licks Kevins face.] Yeah, that a girl, that a girl! Man that stinks!
Gabe: Ugh, man. My delts are blasted. I wish they had a chart for how much protein powder to scoop for a 180 pound man with no fat.
Dwight: Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why don't you just take estrogen? [swallows powder] [coughs] There you go boys. See how papa takes care of you? [kisses bicep] Mwah.
Gabe: I remember when people thought biceps were all that. They'd flex them all night at the discotheque.
Dwight: Oh, I bet you think it's all about core, huh?
Gabe: Yeah.
Dwight: Oh, please.
Gabe: Core's critical. There are four tenets of pilates that I live my life by. One ' lengthen. Two ' elongate.
Jim: Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Who's the strongest? Well, there's only one way to solve that ' flat curl contest.
Jim: All right, here we go everybody. May the manliest man win. Go.
Dwight: Feast on this, Lewis.
Gabe: I love the burn. The burn is where I live.
Jim: Come on, Gabe, you can't handle his hamstrings. You're getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Gabe: Speed set. One. Two.
Jim: Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Dwight: Oh, thank you.
Jim: You're welcome.
Gabe: Five. Six.
Jim: Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
All: Eight, nine, ten.
Gabe: We got it?
Dwight: Very funny Jim.
Gabe: Yeah, Jim. Way to mock us for perfecting our bodies.
Robert: Everyone, conference room, now. [Dwight and Gabe stand up, falling over]
Jim: All right, easy there, grandpa.
Dwight: I don't need your help.
Jim: Okay. You don't need my help?
Dwight: Here, here' Just'
Andy: Morning.
Erin: Hey.
Andy: Somebody left in such a hurry this morning that she forgot' these.
Erin: Oh.
Andy: You know the only thing more delicious than your feet is the feast that I am going to prepare for everyone.
Erin: Andy, if you're gonna hang out for a while, uh'
Andy: What's this?
Erin: This dumb rule Robert made, he just wants visitors to sign in.
Andy: Is this Robert's attempt to embarrass me?
Erin: No, of course not. It's just ' I think it's like if we make an exception for you, then we have to make an exception for the water guy, and then, it's like, where does it end? So just' [puts visitors tag on Andy]
Andy: Why is it when other people spend all their time at the office, they're rewarded for it, and when I do it, I am told it's a little much? 'Is it because I am not an employee anymore, because that's what it feels like.
Jim: All right, well, enjoy the alumni game.
Dwight: Good, we have a deal?
Jim: Thanks Janet.
Dwight: Thanks so much Earl.
Jim: Wow, simultaneous sale.
Dwight: And they said it couldn't be done. Boom!
Jim: Screw 'em.
Andy: Lot going on guys. What's happening?
Jim: Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Andy: That was a fine branch. Things are really bad under Robert California, I guess. It's like a festival of poo.
Jim: Hey, hey, come on, language.
Dwight: Yeah, and we're not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
Jim: In the fridge.
Dwight: No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Jim: Sorry, man, I can't focus on zingers. There's too many potential clients.
Stanley: You two better watch yourselves.
Phyllis: Yeah, the Syracuse branch can't be happy you're taking New York clients.
Robert: Shh' shh' [vomits in trash can]
Jim: Robert?
Oscar: Why did Binghamton close?
Robert: Can everyone just, please' I had a one-man saturnalia last night, in celebration of the finalization of my divorce. I got into a case of Australian reds, and ' how should I say this ' Columbian whites. What ' what is this about, uh, Binghamton?
Kevin: The branch closed. Forever.
Robert: Closing the Binghamton branch never occurred to me before today. Or, I guess, last night. But, in vino veritas as they say, I'm not gonna start doubting my drunken self now.
Nellie: I got your voicemail. From ' from last night.
Robert: Wonderful.
Nellie: And the answer' is yes, yes, yes, yes, and never. [leaves]
Robert: Pam, when's the last time you lived so intensely that your brain literally couldn't hold the memories in?
Pam: Oh, it was this summer '
Robert: Apparently, I left a phone message for Nellie last night, and I need you to find out what I said.
Pam: Um, I am a little busy.
Robert: Yes, 'course. Why don't you list the things that would keep you from helping me.
Pam: Yeah, I can make you a list.
Robert: Let's do it now. What's number one?
Pam: Why don't I help you now?
Robert: There we go.
Pam: Okay.
Harry: Who the hell are Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute?
Erin: Jim, Dwight, what are your last names?
Dwight: And you are'
Harry: Harry Jannerone, Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.
Harry: What the hell's all this?
Andy: Uh, cherries jubilee over homemade gelato.
Harry: You live well down here in P.A. I want to talk to you guys right now. Oh, and Lloyd Gross too. Which one's that guy?
Jim: The salesmen have a commission cap, but we figured out a way around it.
Dwight: Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to ' how do I put this ' steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Jim: Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman. [shows sketch]
Dwight: [pointing at Toby] There he is. That's Lloyd.
Toby: Me?
Creed: Yeah, you.
Harry: Where do you get off crossing state lines?
Toby: Now, we're actually a lot closer to Binghamton than you are. Kimosabe.
Toby: I like to think Lloyd Gross is a no-nonsense guy who doesn't back down from anybody. And he calls people 'Kimosabe'.
Harry: They're New York. We're New York. Sate line is the dividing line. That's the way it's always been.
Jim: There's actually not a rule that says that.
Dwight: That's true.
Toby: That's true. There's no rule. You can check the employee handbook. Oh, can I check the employee handbook Lloyd? Well, does it say anything about me choking a man with my bare hands?
Toby: No.
Dwight: Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I could've choked so many people by now.
Harry: Stay out of my state. It's in your best interest to stay out of my state.
Toby: I've seen guys like you. Big guys who like to push the little guys around. Lloyd Gross eats bullies like you for breakfast.
Harry: Just stay out of New York, Lloyd.
Toby: Hey, text from the old wife. Gonna take that. [runs outside]
Jim: How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Harry: Robert's here. Look at us. Bickering like schoolgirls, looking around the room for things to hit each other with. I don't think we were doing that.
Dwight: Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jim's leg.
Robert: Where's the Advil, Jim? I think I've hit my limit on the Tylenol ' Oh.
Andy: [Doing dishes] Sorry, not Jim.
Robert: Andrew, what do we have to do to get rid of you? Hire you back and send Erin back to Florida?
Andy: Message received loud and clear. Just have to get the caramelized sugar off the pan before it dries.
Robert: Oh, for god '
Harry: Robert California. What a surprise you're here in Scranton.
Robert: Harry'
Harry: So why would you close Binghamton down without a transition plan in place?
Robert: How do you mean?
Andy: I forgot, a' a pan, uh '
Harry: No, no, no, no, no, kid, stay there, do your dishes, go ahead.
Robert: Harry there is a time for every decision, predetermined many years ago. There's no benefit in questioning why this particular decision seems' so poorly timed.
Dwight: Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Harry: Listen, Robert, I don't have time. There's a big client in play. Prestige direct mail solutions '
Dwight: Don't listen to him.
Harry: Used to be Binghamton's '
Dwight: Nope.
Harry: I want it, it's mine.
Dwight: Prestige is ours. Okay, they're responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Harry: We need you to make a decision.
Dwight: Make a decision.
Robert: I have decided. Neither of you are to have any contact with either Prestige or any other Binghamton client until I have figured out how to divide things up. As Solomon once said' [Andy walks out]
Andy: Some bizarre energy in this place today. Robert is going off the rails, making some funky decisions. Like why is nobody gonna call on Prestige? That is a huge client. [walking to car] I mean, they could give their business to the first person to walk in the door. Could be any idiot. Any idiot at all.
Robert: Shaping a company is, in a sense, similar to training a geisha. You have to mold not merely the physical form, but also the character. The two must harmonize. Are they still there? [camera pans to right, Harry, Dwight, and Jim watching Robert in conference room] They want a decision who gets the big client. Well, they can wait. I'll still be talking about geishas long past their bedtime. You know, I trained as one.
Harry: Is it just me or is our boss a freakin' weirdo? [stands up, walks outside] I'm gonna get some air.
Dwight: Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Jim: [Gets up and looks out Nellie's office window] He's running!
Dwight: Damn it!
Jim: Damn it.
Dwight: Wha ' what is this supposed to be?
Jim: It's a monkey.
Dwight: Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. It's got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
Jim: Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Dwight: What?
Jim: Is that him?
Dwight: It's him! Do something! Get out!
Jim: What? What am I gonna do? I don't '
Dwight: Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood. [Jim opens passenger door] That's it? Oh, that's great. That's like a five second delay.
Jim: Dwight!
Dwight: Come on, let's go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Jim: Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
Dwight: Yeah.
Jim: Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Dwight: Hit the nos.
Jim: Are you sure?
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Brace yourself. 3' 2'
Dwight: Got it. Go.
Jim: 1. Here we go! [turns on wipers]
Andy: Hello. Andy Bernard to see the C.E.O.
Receptionist: Oh, do you have an appointment?
Andy: No, I do not.
Receptionist: Okay, I think I can squeeze you in.
Andy: Seriously? 'Cause I could just be anyone. I mean, I thought I was gonna have to convince you.
Receptionist: He's really not that busy.
Mr. Ramish: Is there someone here to see me?
Receptionist: Yes, this man.
Mr. Ramish: Come on in. [Andy walks in]
Pam: So'what do you make of this Robert California guy? I mean, what does a guy like that do on an average weeknight?
Nellie: Oh. Oh, I'll tell you what he does.
Angela: : [walks in] Hello! Hello, my clucking hens. Got room for another in the roost? Huh? Don't worry, I won't lay an egg.
Angela: : Robert sent me to take over if Pam fails. If? [laughs]
Angela: : I have been crunching numbers all day. Math is for boys. I need girl talk.
Gabe: Did someone say girl talk?
Gabe: Sometimes I wonder if I have ovaries in my scrotum, because I am great at girl talk.
Gabe: Have you guys been watching any good Korean soap operas? I'm pretty deep into Hee-Jungcinderella girl. Although, I definitely fast-forward through the young-Tae storylines.
Nellie: Do you think I'd like that, or is it important to have an Asian fetish?
Gabe: Uh, I think you're gonna need to have an Asian fetish. Yeah. [chuckles] It'll be upsetting if you don't.
Andy: I'm a former paper executive. I know the product. I know the margins. I can save you 25% on your costs.
Mr. Ramish: Why haven't I heard of you? You got any references?
Andy: No. I'm a rogue.
Mr. Ramish: Uh-huh.
Andy: Which is the best part. That means you will be my first customer and your business will get 100% of my attention. Now' [pulls out business card] I have written down my personal phone number. You call this anytime.
Mr. Ramish: Every salesman I've ever met has given me his personal phone number.
Andy: Of course they have. Which is why I'm giving you a key to my house. [gives key to C.E.O] Whatever you need ' anytime, night or day ' you just stop on by.
Mr. Ramish: You want me to drive to your house if I need paper.
Andy: Maybe you just want someone to talk to. Maybe' you need a place to crash for a couple of days. My wireless password is eat pray love. Easy to remember.
Dwight: Ready? Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. [takes off belt, ties doors together]
Dwight: [Running] Ahhh! [Slides into elevator]
Jim: You all right?
Dwight: Yeah. [Doors about to close, hand stops them] Oh.
Jim: Ah! [Harry walks in]
Jim: [Dwight pushes button for floor two] Dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight: Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
Jim: What are you talking about?
Dwight: Just run! Take the stairs!
Jim: I don't even know where the stairs are!
Dwight: I'll stall him. Go!
Jim: God!
Harry: [Dwight jumping] What are you doing?
Dwight: I'm gonna activate the seismic failsafe. We'll be stuck between floors for hours. [pants fall down] Oh. [Jim runs in] My pants fell down.
Jim: What?
Dwight: My pants fell down! I don't have a belt!
Dwight: [walks into lobby] Hello, sir. Good day. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. Forgive my pants, they fell down. An appointment with Mr. Ramish, please. Right now is fine. No, no, no, I was here first. Dwight K. Schrute. Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Mr. Ramish: What's going on?
Dwight: Well '
Harry: Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone. Dunder Mifflin, Syracuse '
Dwight: I was here first.
Mr. Ramish: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.
Dwight: I already made an appointment' with your secretary.
Mr. Ramish: Let me stop you all right here. I've already picked a new paper supplier.
Dwight: Wait, it's not D.M Utica, is it?
Mr. Ramish: No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all actually. It's' Big Red Paper Company.
Jim: Big Red Paper Company?
Mr. Ramish: Mm-hmm.
Andy: Yes, yes, yes!
Harry: Give me a cup of coffee.
Dwight: Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
Jim: All right, guys. It didn't work out for any of us, so' we're still on the same team. Let me get these.
Dwight: No. Let him get his own. It's Syracuse money.
Harry: You know, your partner's got a lotta attitude. But I like that. How long you guys been dating?
Dwight: Jim couldn't land me in a thousand years.
Jim: But you're saying there's a chance.
Dwight: Shut up.
Pam: [Walks into conference room] Hey.
Robert: Hmm.
Pam: I stole Nellie's phone.
Robert: Excellent. Excellent. Though troubling that your first instinct is thievery.
Pam: What do you want from me?
Robert: Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's 'yes, yes, yes, yes, never.'
Phone: Hi, Nell, it's mom. Do keep your chin up. It can't be as bad as you described.
Robert: Oh yes it can.
Phone: This is MasterCard. You are over the limit. Send the minimum payment of $448 by Monday, or we will be forced to send it to collections.
Robert: Shopaholic.
Pam: Sounds like it.
Robert: Yeah.
Phone: Hi, sis. Is your boss still hitting on you?
Robert: Ah.
Phone: This is Annie from second nests. I'm sorry, but the Romanian orphanage felt more comfortable with a two-person nuclear family than a single mother, so, we're gonna hold out for that.
Pam: Okay, that's enough. [grabs phone]
Robert: Pam, we need to get to the bottom of this.
Pam: No, no, no!
Robert: No, come on.
Pam: Robert! Okay, oops! I deleted them all. They're all deleted.
Robert: Pam, Pam, you've completely bungled this!
Pam: Ah. Ahh. [walks out]
Pam: Hey.
Nellie: Can I do it, Pam? Can I put off a gold Arabian sandal?
Pam: Um' yes. Definitely. With your hair '
Nellie: Oh!
Pam: Certainly. Um' you dropped your cell phone.
Nellie: Oh, gosh.
Pam: Yep.
Nellie: Thank you. I'm' so stupid.
Pam: No. My goodness. You have a lot going on. With Robert and everything.
Nellie: Oh, god, Pam. Don't get me started.
Pam: No, I will not.
Nellie: You've just got me started. Robert' is' a filthy beast. I mean, don't you get the feeling, he's just thinking of fifteen different ways to do you?
Pam: Well '
Nellie: I mean, the man talks of nothing but sex.
Pam: But sometimes he talks about flesh' and bacchanals.
Nellie: I cannot even tell you what he left on my phone last night.
Pam: No' don't. Just put it out of your mind.
Nellie: Pam, what is your address? I'm gonna send you a pair of these gold harem shoes. Oh, no. You don't '
Nellie: Oh yes. Come on, a little gold Arabian slipper.
Nellie: Things are looking up. I might be a mother soon. I have MasterCard right where I want them. And' I have a new friend. A friend. At work.
Robert: [Erin opens door] Erin.
Erin: There's a call for you on line one.
Robert: Who is it?
Erin: He says salvation. No last name.
Robert: Yeah, hello?
Andy: [in car] You once put me on a list of the losers in the office. Well, this loser just got your biggest client to give him all their business. So hire me back, that business is yours. Don't, and I will find another buyer.
Robert: You're blackmailing me.
Andy: It's just business.
Robert: Ah, well, I will not be blackmailed by some ineffectual, privileged, effete, soft-penised debutante. You wanna start a street fight with me, bring it on. You're gonna be surprised by how ugly it gets. You don't even know my real name. I'm the *bleep* lizard king. [disconnects]
Andy: Whoa. Well I gave him a chance. [gets out of car, walks to house]
David: [opens door] Andy Bernard.
Andy: You got a minute?
David: Um' I'm in the middle of a piano lesson.
Andy: I wanted to see if I could interest you in an investment. Dunder Mifflin.
David: Dunder Mifflin. [closes door] Now' why would I want that? It's worth half of what it was three years ago.
Andy: Exactly. And you know better than anyone that with the right management it could be worth twice what you would pay for it today.
David: Why don't you come in? [Andy walks in, closes door]
Harry: So what would you do if you weren't selling paper?
Jim: Oh, man, I'd have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
Dwight: What?
Jim: Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Dwight: How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You don't even care about nationals.
Harry: Nothing?
Jim: I don't know. I've always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Harry: I'd like to sell one big thing, you know? Like' a plane. One sale, I'm out.
Jim: That sounds lovely.
Harry: Anyway, Robert's gonna run this company into the ground, so' We won't be doing this in six months.
Oscar: [to webcam] Hello. My name's Oscar. I'm an accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania and I'm gay. And I'm here to tell you that yes- it does get better. When I was younger, um-
Phyllis: What's he doing?
Dwight: He's searching out younger gays.
Phyllis: Oh.
Oscar: No, it's just a way to tell young people, no matter how hard it gets for them, there's a brighter future ahead.
Dwight: ...with you. [chuckles]
Oscar: No matter how hard it gets for you, eh- Kelly, seriously, I-
Kelly: Just keep chatting. I'm just checking my makeup in your webcam.
Oscar: Do you not own a mirror?
Kelly: Webcams make me look the way I do in my fantasies.
Pam: I know, right? What is it? You always look so good in those things.
Kelly: I'm throwing out all my mirrors.
Oscar: Okay, as you can see, I now have a cool job at a dynamic workplace. Being gay is a celebration of life, it's a simple-
Robert: No, I'm sorry, I just can't sit idly by and have the gay youth of America misled by some reductionist-
Oscar: It's not misleading.
Robert: -pep talk. Sexuality is a spectrum. It's a paradox to think of any sexual activity as 'normal.' It gets better but it also gets vastly more complicated.
Kevin: Hey, Robert, that guy, he looks just like you. [Robert backs into Kevin's nose] Ooh! [whimpers]
Robert: Ow! Damn it, Kevin! God!
Dwight: You okay, Robert?
Robert: Fine.
Dwight: Put some ice on it.
Oscar: In any case, it gets better. [Kevin cries] Maybe- maybe not much better... but better.
Sasha: One, two, three!
Dwight: I wanted to give a nice gift to the tenants in the building. At first I thought, 'muffin basket.' Then I thought, 'What's even more precious to people than muffins?'
Jake: Can you just smile, please?
Meredith: I don't want to!
Dwight: ...their own children.
Dwight: Hey everybody, just a few hours left for the free family portrait studio. Darryl. We'd love to see little Jada come by. Angela? Why don't you bring by your little angel?
Angela: No thank you.
Dwight: Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
Jim: I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
Jim: Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.
Dwight: [Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!
Jim: Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.
Darryl: Let me get this straight. You lost all of it. All your winnings. A hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Hide: Bad economy. Bad investment.
Darryl: You mean to tell me no one wanted an energy drink for Asian homosexuals?
Calvin: They did not.
Darryl: And you got half a million of these? Well I gotta try it.
Calvin: I wouldn't.
Darryl: Aw, come on. What's the harm? [makes face] Mmm. What flavor was that?
Hide: Coconut penis.
Darryl: The coconut's pretty subtle.
Calvin: Come on, man. Can't you just give us a yes or a no?
Darryl: I don't know, man. Y'all quit with a lot of confidence. I mean, it was like, y'all came up in here dancing and everybody was- [sees Val] ooh, hold on a second. [sees Brandon] Oh.
Darryl: If I were Val, I would break up with Brandon. Then I would date the hell out of me. I wouldn't give in to me too fast, let me buy myself some nice dinners and such. But when I finally did give in, I would go crazy on myself.
Andy: [wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.
Jim: How's it going, man?
Andy: [whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?
Jim: Great, yeah, good.
Gabe: Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.
Nellie: Oh God.
Andy: Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...
Nellie: No, you don't understand-
Andy: Clean the toilets.
Nellie: I don't need anyone to-
Andy: Pull the poop out of the toilets.
Nellie: That's not even a thing.
Andy: Just, please...
Nellie: Andy.
Andy: Please!
Nellie: Andy.
Andy: Give me something!
Nellie: Why don't you clean the carpets for today?
Andy: Thank you.
Nellie: You're welcome. Up you get then. Pick yourself up. There it is.
Andy: Thank you.
Nellie: You don't need to-
Andy: I have a delicious secret.
Creed: Good, good. This carpet's overdue for a good mopping.
Jim: Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
Andy: Yeah, it is actually.
Andy: Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.
Pam: [enters with the kids] Family picture!
Jim: Pam? No!
Pam: What? Honey, we talked about this.
Jim: No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Pam: Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.
Jim: No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
Pam: No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?
Jim: Nope.
Pam: We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.
Jim: But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
Pam: No, no.
Jim: Nope.
Pam: But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.
Jim: That's-
Pam: Yes!
Jim: That's-
Pam: And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.
Jim: Okay.
Kevin: Wait, C-R-A-Z...
Dwight: Great, right up there.
Pam: Yeah?
Jim: Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Alright. Why don't you just-
Pam: Oh, great. Thank you.
Jim: -give him to me and... perfect.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: This is great.
Pam: You ready?
Jim: Excuse me.
Pam: There we go.
Jim: Just do it.
Pam: I'll just stand here?
Jim: Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Photographer: Sir, could you look into the camera?
Jim: Let's do it, shoot it.
Photographer: Sir.
Jim: Great.
Dwight: Up here. [whistles]
Jim: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dwight: Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.
Jim: Oh, so that's it?
Dwight: That's it.
Pam: See? That wasn't so hard.
Dwight: Cute kids, thanks for coming.
Senator Lipton: Hello, Erin. Hello, everybody.
Angela: Uh, what? Why? Uh, hi honey. What- how are you doing?
Senator Lipton: Hi, you know, my office got a call that they were shooting family portraits right here. And if there's one thing that every politician instinctively understands, it's a good photo op.
Phyllis: [laughs] Yeah.
Angela: Heh.
Erin: Okay, you're going to go through the hallway. Here's a map. And if you get lost, just follow the blue line. [points to line on floor]
Senator Lipton: Thanks.
Dwight: Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.
Angela: Dwight.
Dwight: Nice to see you. May I hold him?
Senator Lipton: Sure.
Angela: No. I am going to hold him because I haven't seen him all day.
Angela: I think that Dwight is doing this whole thing to, um, get a sample of my baby's DNA to prove he's the father. Which... is impossible... because the senator is the only man I've ever been with.
Angela: [Phillip cries] See the duckie!
Dwight: Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.
Senator Lipton: Oh, thank you.
Angela: [slaps Dwight's hand away] No. No. I like the baby's hair the way it is.
Dwight: Really?
Andy: This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.
Andy: Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.
Nellie: Well, I don't want any soup.
Andy: But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!
Nellie: Oh come on, Andy!
Erin: I know this is going to be a great payoff.
Andy: A delicious moment.
Erin: But after you're manager, some of these images are going to be hard to shake.
Andy: Well, but it-
Erin: Just calibrate. Okay? Calibrate.
Dwight: Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-
Angela: Uh-uh, leave us alone.
Senator Lipton: I guess we're okay with the fingernails.
Dwight: Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
Angela: Dwight, we're fine!
Senator Lipton: Oopsie, did somebody make a boopsie?
Angela: Oh no. [laughs]
Senator Lipton: I'm just gonna take him out and change him just for a second.
Dwight: He defecated, aw.
Senator Lipton: You're stinky.
Darryl: A lot has changed since y'all left, okay? You're gonna have to jump through some hoops. And the new foreman is here. Now she's one of the best we've ever known, okay? So I need you to show her your upmost respect. Make sure she feels welcome and at home, okay? Can you do that?
Brandon: That's some pretty blatant complementing you're doing there, man. I don't even talk to her like that.
Val: Uh, Brandon?
Darryl: I would.
Brandon: You would?
Darryl: Yeah.
Brandon: Sounds like you're trying to hit on my girlfriend.
Val: Calm down, he's not.
Darryl: Yes, I am. Just so everyone's on the same page.
Brandon: [scoffs] So you really think she's gonna leave a guy who owns his own restaurant for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
Val: Brandon!
Darryl: Good slam.
Brandon: Thank you, Biggie.
Darryl: Good luck to you.
Brandon: Oh, and have a burger for me.
Senator Lipton: Okay, shall we take a few more?
Angela: I think we have all the shots we need. Thank you, Dwight.
Senator Lipton: Okay. There we go.
Angela: No! Dwight! Give me the diaper! Dwight!
Dwight: Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?
Toby: Andy, we wanted to talk to you. A lot of us are very concerned about you.
Nellie: You're dirty, you stink of booze, you're limping inexplicably.
Andy: I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.
Jim: No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Erin: No, unfortunately it's true. He's been a nightmare. And the worst part is, he's been taking it out on me.
Nellie: What?
Pam: You hit her?
Andy: No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.
Erin: He's not hitting me. But, he's been verbally abusing me-
Andy: That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.
Gabe: [enters] Happy birthday to Gabe!
Nellie: Oh, get out, skeleton man!
Toby: I can refer you to someone to talk to.
Andy: [his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.
Toby: Give you a name or-
Andy: I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!
Jim: Oh boy.
Pam: Oh, Andy.
Oscar: What?
Andy: I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.
Oscar: David Wallace hasn't worked here in years.
Andy: Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.
Jim: Andy, come on.
Kevin: Even I know that's weird.
Andy: I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.
Toby: Hey, Andy, Nobody's calling you crazy, Andy. We're your friends, Andy.
Andy: Stop saying my name.
Erin: No, he's not making this up.
Andy: Thank you, Erin.
Erin: Andy tells me about seeing David Wallace all the time.
Pam: But have you ever actually seen him yourself?
Erin: Oh my God.
Andy: Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.
Toby: Do you see David Wallace in the room right now?
Dwight: [into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.
Kelly: Now you look at me like you're adoring me, I'm gonna look at the camera like I don't even know you're there.
Ravi: I do adore you.
Robert: Andrew, it's time for you to go home. You're better than this.
Andy: Yeah, I know.
Robert: Everyone's better than this, because this is the worst thing I have ever seen. [drinks coconut penis energy drink] Why'd they add coconut? I miss original.
Jim: Hey.
Others: Hey!
David: Hey guys, long time.
Pam: David, what are you doing here?
Phyllis: Is it true you're buying the company?
David: Okay, I guess the word is out. Uh, please keep this a secret, but yes, I've been talking with Andy-
Andy: What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?
David: I'll get to that in a second, Andy.
Andy: But it's- it is- it is me? Right?
David: Yes, as we've discussed-
Andy: What?
David: But it's very possible-
Andy: Oh my God!
David: Probable.
Andy: Wow. From janitor to manager?
David: Yep.
Andy: That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.
David: There's an official announcement, a few details to be-
Andy: From total loss to total boss, I mean-
Stanley: Can we expect any payroll interruptions?
David: Now that is a great question, Stanley. Right now I think all your operations or most of your operations are pretty much down in Florida, so to shift back up-
Andy: I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.
Phyllis: So we're not gonna be a part of Sabre anymore?
David: Actually, nothing is gonna be a part of Sabre anymore. Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating the rest of the company.
Robert: Oof. [laughs] Wouldn't wanna be a Sabre employee right about now. [laughs] I'm actually the CEO.
David: Ah, I didn't realize you were standing there.
Robert: Hey, my friend, trust me. This is for the best. I never understood that corporate mess.
David: Well, okay. Great to meet you.
Robert: Likewise, I'm Bob. Bob Kazamakis.
David: Pleasure.
Robert: I'd love to give you a little rundown on what I've learned about this place.
David: That's very gracious of you, Bob. I would love that.
Robert: Please. [laughs]
Andy: Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.
Jim: Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
Andy: Gosh, I hope so.
Angela: No! God, Mose! God!
Mose: Hi, Angela.
Angela: Get out of the car! Get out! Where is he?
Mose: I'm not supposed to say.
Angela: Yes! [slaps Mose] Tell me! Tell me where he is! Mose, damn it! Where did he go? Mose! Get back here!
Darryl: [taking photo with Jada] Let's see that smile. Go on. [waves to Val]
Val: [stands next to him] Right here?
Darryl: Cool.
Andy: Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.
Nellie: May I say one thing?
Andy: It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.
Nellie: The quality of mercy is not strained.
Andy: No.
Nellie: It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
Andy: Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?
Nellie: It blesseth he who gives and he who takes. 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.
Andy: I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?
Andy: If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?
Nellie: Special projects manager, that's my background. I just go around doing whatever I want.
Andy: All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?
David: Okay everyone. I had a conversation with Bob, and since I am going to be CEO now there'll be no need for him.
Meredith: Ouch. That's gotta hurt!
David: But, he is going to be making so much money from the liquidation, he's gonna be freed up to do something much more important.
Robert: David has generously offered to donate one million dollars in matching funds to a cause that's very dear to me. So, for the next three years, I'll be travelling overseas, concentrating all of my efforts on educating- mentoring, some African, some Asian, but mainly Eastern European women.
David: I had no idea how pervasive this problem was until Bob explained it to me.
Robert: Oprah Winfrey's leadership academy and other schools like it, while wonderful, end with high school. I want to see these girls right through college, especially the gymnasts. They've lost so many years of crucial education to perfecting their bodies. Muscle groups the rest of us can't even fathom.
Andy: Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?
Robert: Yeah, so I'm hoping to identify some truly exceptional women who show great promise. Well, Andy, it's been fun.
Andy: Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]
Robert: It's been a great year.
Dwight: Hello.
Angela: Where is it?
Dwight: They're testing it now.
Angela: How long does it take to get the results?
Dwight: Seventy-two hours.
Angela: You're gonna wait here?
Dwight: Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand]
Angela: [Dwight kisses her] Dwight, I can't do this. Dwight!
Senator Lipton: Hey.
Oscar: Senator Lipton. Hey, how are you?
Senator Lipton: You didn't call.
Oscar: Um, well, uh, the issue that I- that concerned me...
Senator Lipton: You know what this is about. [covers Phillip's eyes] Call.
Erin: Oh. Hey, champions.
Toby: Good morning.
Clark: Quater finals in an hour.  Hope you got some sleep cause I am going to be haunting your nightmares tonight.
Erin: I did. I got some really good sleep.
Clark: Did you? [pushes pencil cup at Erin]
Erin: [grabs pencils out of cup quickly as cup falls] Bzzz.
Dwight: Yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest.  It was being sponsored by Weyer-Hammer Paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product Airstream Deluxe A4, the Cadillac of paper. It's not so easy on the environment, if you know what I mean. [whispers] Practically made of plastic.
Nellie: We started with sixteen brave aviators. Some use skill [cut to Kevin flying paper airplane], others relied on showmanship [cut to Dwight throwing airplane at Nate with an apple on his head] others seem not to comprehend what a paper airplane is. [cut to Creed throwing a melon] And of course, there was the odd moment of heartbreak and disaster.
Toby: Hey I left my glasses down here somewhere. Crossing through, beep beep. [Pam's plane hit Toby in the eye]
Toby: Ow! Ow!
Pam: I didn't see you! You should have yelled 'Crossing!'
Toby: [crying] I'm sorry!
Pam: Ok, so is that my spot?
Nellie: We are now down to an elite eight.  Well, seven and Toby.
Andy: [Reading from script] Be careful of that beaker, it contains dangerous acid!
Darryl: It does not say dangerous. And there's no exclamation point.
Andy: Well I'm just trying to bring some life to it.
Andy: Last week I got an agent and uh, this week I got a movie. HRPDC chemical handling protocols.  It's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community. One of whom could have a cousin whose brother's Brad Pitt.  And boom, next thing you know, I'm in Moneyballs Two.
Toby: Andy?
Andy: Go away, we're running lines.
Toby: You wanted to see the gooey eye.
Andy: Oh yeah. Alright, get over here. I am so freaked out by things going into eyes. I just- wow. [moves to lift Toby's eye patch] Uggggh! I can't even, I'm so freaked out by that, just go. Go go go go go.
Toby: Alright, it's getting gooier so we'll just do it later.
Andy: Yeah, Ok. [Closes door] Alright. Where were we?
Darryl: Something full of acid.
Andy: And remember:  Do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water. You will only exacerbate the flame. The dangerous flame.
Darryl: [claps] That was great man. Alright, I'm out of here.
Andy: W-w-w-wait. Stop stop stop. Don't go anywhere.  I just need to find more colors. Let's do it six more times.
Jim: Hey. I just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and I really appreciate that.
Pam: Thank you. I appreciate that you appreciate that.
Pam: So, we had couple's therapy.
Jim: No shame in that. Get it all out in the open.
Pam: And we have homework.
Jim: Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly.
Pam: And we're also supposed to speak our truths.
Jim: Mmhm.
Pam: Because if I had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to Philly, then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy.
Jim: Oh, we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do 'opportunities.'
Andy: Heads up everyone. If you really need something from me today, let's get it done tomorrow.  Carla Fern got me a gig.
Pam: Hey!
Andy: Yeah.
Stanley: Who's Carla Fern?
Andy: Who is Carla Fern? Well, wow. Uh, she's my agent and my drill sargent. And one of my best friends. Oh, and Oscar, I already figured it out. If I have to get emotional in the film, I'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the Senator.
Oscar: Why wouldn't you use your own life? Erin just dumped you.
Andy: Little raw. Not cool Oscar.
Oscar: But you just!
Andy: Not cool.
Nellie: Hey. Day two. Drama in the warehouse skies. This is Robert from Weyer-Hammer Paper, who will be joining us to judge the final rounds.
Robert: Who's pumped for the quarter finals, huh?
Dwight: I'm pumped!
Erin: Clark's a dead man.
Robert: Alright. Sounds like somebody wants to walk away with this. [holds up large check for $2,000]
Angela: Oh my god!
Group: Whoa.
Angela: Nellie you didn't tell us we could win money.
Nellie: Oh yes I did, I told you all. It was..um, cause that's an awful lot of money for me to forget.
Stanley: Not one of us remembers you saying anything about two thousand dollars.
Nellie: I forgot. I completely forgot. But at least now that large piece of cardboard that man was carrying around makes sense.
Erin: Nellie, this is a competition.  Please take it seriously.
Nellie: Oh please. [Dwight watches Angela folding paper airplane]
Angela: Me? Oh, I'm fine. I mean, sure, times are leaner now that I'm separated from the Senator.  But my new studio apartment is just fine [camera shows small cluttered space with excessive cats and Phillip crying] for me.. and Phillip... and Tinky... and Crinklepuss, and Bandit 2, and Pawlick Baggins, and Lady Aragorn and their 10 kittens.
Phillip: [cries]
Angela: Come here, come here. Let's go.
Angela: I had a chance with Dwight, but I didn't take it. And if I went back now, when I'm broke and he just inherited a farm, I'd be one of those gold-digging tramps you read about that try to bag a farmer.
Dwight: I offered myself to Angela and she turned me down. If she changes her mind, the next move is hers. I'm with Esther now.  She's younger than Angela, sturdier, more comfortable with the scent of a manured field. Let's be honest. When it came to manured fields, Angela was at best indifferent.
Clark: Oh, wide wings, interesting.
Erin: Hey. Why don't you back off?[looks at Pete]...I mean best of luck to you in the competition.
Erin: Growing up in an orphanage, you have to fight other kids. For everything. Snacks, pillows, parents. I'm kinda worried about Pete seeing that side of me. I once ripped greedy Susan's pigtail right off her head. Just for a handful of Crispix.
Carla Fern: Are you in that paper documentary too?
Darryl: Yep.
Carla Fern: Do you need an agent?
Andy: No. He's- I mean, you've never acted in anything before. He's just my entourage.
Darryl: I was in The Whiz in high school.
Andy: That's the cleaky clacker! He clicks that and then the guy says 'action.'
Carla Fern: Hey, I made them get you a chair.  All my clients sit.
Woman: Can I take your picture?
Andy: I guess it's starting. Um, yeah.  Of course. Yeah sure.  Tell you what. I'll put my arm around you and then I can take it-
Woman: We just need a picture of the top of your head in case we burn some of your hair off.
Andy: Got it. [lowers head to show hair, but keeps looking up just as she tries to take the picture]
Woman: No, if you could just keep it down until..
Andy: Sorry.
Nellie: OK, next up we have two creatures great and small. Kevin versus Angela.
Kevin: Yes!
Dwight: Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself?
Kevin: Uh huh.
Dwight: Well, what am I thinking? Of course you made that yourself. Cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane.
Kevin: Of course.
Nellie: Kevin, did you make that yourself?
Kevin: Yes. In a way. From one that I bought on Craigslist.
Nellie: Oh man.
Dwight: I call for a refold!
Kevin: No.
Angela: Really? [to Dwight] Thank you.
Kevin: This is flatter.
Dwight: It's a piece of paper. You fold it into an airplane.
Nellie: Ok, that's enough.  This is the end of the ring now. You have to pick one.
Kevin: I can't. I love them all too much. And, none of them fly. So that makes it harder.
Nellie: You have to choose one now.
Kevin: Fine. [throws plane, doesn't fly]
Nellie: Angela advances.
Erin: Nice.
Dwight: [clapping] Whoo!
Angela: Was Dwight rooting for me? Hmm. I hadn't noticed.
Kevin: I'm not giving up.  I'm going to keep making planes until one of them flies. Like Wilbur and Orville Redenbacher.
Jim: An Earl Grey tea for the lady.
Pam: Oh, thank you. I acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea.
Jim: Thank you. I like being appreciated. But, to speak my truth, it wasn't out of the way because I felt like a tea anyway. So, one trip.
Pam: Well, to speak my truth, I switched to coffee in March.  There's a new espresso machine. But I still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture.
Director: We are rolling and...action!
Andy: [Happily] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols. These protocols could save you from severe injury, even death.
Producer: Ok, um, stop. Um, why are you smiling so much?
Andy: Just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job.
Director: Ok, well maybe no smiling on this one.
Andy: So how do you want, how should I do it?
Director: I don't know, just like you're reporting the news or something. Ok?
Andy: [ridiculous news voice] This video is to demonstrate the HPRDC chemical handling protocols.
Director: Ok.
Andy: It's Tom Brokaw, it's a newscaster.
Director: Who was that?
Andy: Tom Brokaw!
Dwight: Come on Clark!
Angela: Come on Clark. [Clark throws plane, Erin throws plane it goes much farther]
Dwight: Whoa!
Erin: Yeah! Oh! Eat it piggy! Eat it! Oink oink oink oink!
Clark: We've still gotta work together, so we should keep it civil.
Erin: [Snorts and grunts] I can't hear what you said. [snorting, grunting] You got your slop? [Squeals]
Clark: You know what, this is completely unnecessary.  You already won...
Pete: Erin! Erin! Just stop.
Erin: What?
Pete: Relax.
Nellie: Next up we have Dwight and Phyllis.
Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration: You can do it baby!
Angela: No you can't baby! [to Dwight, whispers] Good luck.
Dwight: Watch and learn.
Erin: Wow.
Group: Oh!
Nellie: Dwight defeats Phyllis, Dwight you are through to the semi-finals.
Dwight: Yes!
Angela: Whoo!
Dwight: Oh, Esther.
Esther: Hey.
Dwight: What are you- [Esther kisses him] You're here early.
Esther: Yeah, I plucked the chickens extra fast cause I knew I was seeing you tonight. There might just be a little feather in your nuggets or a little bit of meat inside of your pillow.
Dwight: I like a little feather in my nuggets. [both laugh]
Nellie: Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final four. Dwight, Erin, Angela and god only knows how, but Toby. One of you will walk away with two thousand dollars.
Erin: Yeah!
Director: Ok here you have just knocked over the beaker, the chemicals splashed in your eye.
Andy: Which is insanely painful.
Director: Yeah.
Andy: And I've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to, to really express that pain.
Director: That's great. So what you're gonna do then is come over here to the eye washing station and then just kinda flush out your eyes.  You know, get the chemicals out. Alright?
Andy: So I just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later?
Director: What water special effect?
Producer: Yeah, yeah just hold your lids open with one hand and let the stream bathe your eyeballs.
Andy: I'm not comfortable doing my own stunts. I'll get nude if you want me to, I'll go full Lena Dunham but I-
Director: Dude, we don't need you to go nude, OK? So just do the eyewash, Ok? That's all we're asking.
Andy: Darryl, what do I do?
Darryl: Hold up, I'm looking at my spit with a microscope.
Andy: They want me to use real water in the eye wash scene.
Darryl: So?
Andy: I can't squirt stuff in my eyeball.  I've never even used an eye dropper.
Production Assistant: So Andy, so you know how to use this.  You step on the pedal, water squirts in your eyes.
Andy: Carla! Carla!
Nellie: It is time for a little T & A. I give you: Toby and Angela.
Angela: [throws plane far] Oh my god! Oh my god. Ok it's your turn. [Toby crumples plane and steps aside.
Nellie: Well, Angela is the winner.
Angela: Yes!
Esther: [to Dwight] Is there a reason that we're excited for that little woman?
Dwight: Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything.
Esther: Oh. Is she a gambler?
Dwight: In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
Esther: Hmm. That is sad.
Carla Fern: [grabs Andy by the cheeks] Andy! If you don't stick your eyes in that machine, I'm going to call every production in North Eastern Pennsylvania.  You won't even make an appearance on a security camera! [Andy starts to cry]
Producer: What's the hold up here?
Director: The actor's crying.
Producer: Oh god.
Andy: She yelled at me. I can't wash my eyeball. I can't do that. I can't.
Darryl: Andy Bernard can't squirt water in his eye and act like it doesn't freak him out. But you know who can? Older Male Lab Assistant Number One.
Andy: Do you believe in me?
Darryl: I believe I want to go home.
Dwight: [throws plane far] Yeah! Ok! Beat that! [Erin throws plane, loses, Dwight laughs] Whoo! Ok.
Erin: Dammit! Dammit, god. [To Pete] Sorry. Yeah I'm fine. I'm fine. I got mad. Cause I don't like losing. I'm just gonna- Sorry I'm mad! I'm mad, I'm really mad. I wanted to win. We were gonna win a lot of money, I was gonna buy you a sweater. It's stupid. Just the whole contest is stupid. That's how it feels.
Pete: Yeah. [Erin kicks box] Whoa!
Erin: Sorry I'm mad! I don't like losing! I thought I was going to win!
Pete: Ok [tries to help her] Hey hey hey, whoa.
Erin: Sorry. Sorry. I'm going to go upstairs and just...
Pam: Oh, I made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting.
Jim: Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar.
Pam: I acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar.
Jim: Thank you. Your mom is a treasure.
Pam: Well, I appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- [Jim's phone rings, he answers]
Jim: Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good.
Pam: Uh, to speak my truth, I'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation. [Jim hangs up phone] I appreciate the sacrifice.
Jim: Ok to speak my truth, that was a little sarcastic. I think that's a little unfair.
Pam: Really? I've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months. And you had to miss one phone call. Is that your truth, Jim? That's really your truth?
Jim: I guess I will swallow my truth.
Clark: Are you guys high? Because if so, to speak my truth, I would appreciate the sacrifice of including me in some hits off your kind buds.
Pam: We're not high.
Pam: I wish we'd started this exercise six months ago. My heart just feels so... blocked up.
Kevin: The Mark 47 is ready for launch. [throws plane but it sticks to his hand] Less paste.
Director: Here we go. Rolling and... action!
Andy: [doing eyewash] AHHH! AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!!
Director: And cut. We can fix the sound in post.
Producer: Yeah.
Andy: I can do a better one.
Producer: That's fine, we'll move on.
Andy: I said I can do a better one. Darryl...
Darryl: Action!
Andy: [eyewashes again] AHH! AHH! AHH!
Carla Fern: Kid can act!
Andy: Yeah! Yeah.
Nellie: Each contestant will throw two aeroplanes.
Dwight: After you.
Angela: Thank you. [plane loops up and falls at her feet] Oh god!
Nellie: Angela's first throw, terrible. Dwight.
Dwight: [fake throws and drops plane] Oh! Oh man! It slipped out of my hand, what a whiff. Ah, how'd that happen? God. [Angela smiles]
Esther: We want you to win. Dwight told me about your situation. It's such a pity. Use the money wisely. [Angela looks disgusted]
Dwight: Alright.
Angela: Don't you dare tank this. [Dwight throws plane far, Angela fake throws and drops her plane]
Nellie: And we have a winner. And it's Dwight. And it is everyone because this is over.
Creed: Two grand huh? I know a guy who can turn that into eight hundred dollars. And it's me.
Angela: [To Esther] Well, I guess you needed the money more than me huh? Use it wisely.
Angela: I was disappointed in Dwight today. He showed a weakness that was unbecoming. Even if he did do it for me. I don't need pity and I don't need charity. I have my dignity and that's enough. And as long as I have that, I'll be ok.
Jim: I know this was really weird, and it was really hard. But I think we're making progress. So I'm really sorry that I have to go but let's keep at this. Ok?
Pam: Ok. [intense moment where Jim leaves and Pam seems conflicted.  She notices his umbrella and runs out to follow him]
Pam: Jim! [hands him umbrella]
Jim: Thanks.
Pam: Alright, have a good trip.
Jim: Bye.
Pam: Bye. [walks away]
Jim: Hey! [Runs after her and looks into her eyes] I... [hugs her tightly, Pam doesn't hug back]
Pastor: [Flashback to Jim & Pam's wedding] Love suffers long and is kind. It is not proud. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. [Pam hugs Jim back finally] And now these three remain: Faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. [Pam kisses Jim]
Pam: I love you.
Jim: I love you.
Jim: I'm taking some time off from work'well, my other work'because we needed it.
Pam: It's great.
Jim: It's great.
Pam: The phone has been ringing off the hook. The guys in Philly are kind of going nuts.
Jim: But that doesn't matter. This does. It's the only thing that matters. We've had some really nice days together.
Pam: Nice morning, too.
Jim: Beesly! Oh, my god.
Andy: Hey. Which tie makes me look like a guy who likes sofas? My agent's putting me up for a furniture commercial.
Jim: Ah, definitely blue.
Andy: Totally, right? So, Big Tuna, what's up? Back in the small pond?
Jim: For now, yeah. I was spreading myself way too thin'
Andy: Thin-sliced tuna. Carpaccio. Go on.
Jim: Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I can't give 100% to two things at once you know.
Andy: Tell me about it, you know? I've been trying to act and manage this branch. Half the time I don't know if I'm wearing my stage makeup or my work makeup.
Jim: Huh. Well, you know, you can't have everything so you gotta ask yourself what makes you the happiest. You just go all in for what's most important. That's my new thing.
Oscar: [noticing Angela looking very unkempt] Is everything ok?
Angela: No. Everything is not okay. The county took my cats.
Kevin: Wait, all of them?
Angela: Two sacks' worth. Apparently my apartment complex has rules about how many pets are too many for a studio. And while I was out picking Phillip up from daycare, they came. They came into my house.
Oscar: That's'that's awful, Angela. I'm so sorry.
Angela: It's the [bleep] that lives downstairs. She's this uptight, judgmental shrew. You know the type.
Kevin: I've never met anyone like that.
Angela: And they're gone. And I have no one left. Without my cats, I am utterly and completely alone.
Oscar: Angela, you still have your son.
Angela: I guess.
Dwight: Attention, everyone. May I have your attention? There are four new deadly weapons in this office. [kicking and punching] Basher, Thrasher, Crasher and'
Jim: Smasher!
Dwight: Smasher? No, where'd you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the city's best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
Dwight: I had to find a new dojo after sensei Ira and I parted ways. My new sensei, sensei Billy, thought I had more than enough training to take the test. Turns out, sensei Ira was a bit of a shyster. Sensei Billy says most students don't spend $150,000 over 20 years to get their black belt.
Dwight: I would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony, right here in the office at lunch, lunch not provided.
Jim: Fireball!
Dwight: Ah! [throws punch] That's how it's done.
Jim: That's pretty good. I feel safe.
David Wallace: Hey, Erin. Is Andy in?
Erin: Oh, is Andy in? Sorry, I thought you said 'is Indian' and was like, 'Is Indian what?' Is Indian food good? Is Indian jewelry pretty? Is Indian hair an expensive kind of wig? Yes, to all three, by the way.
Erin: Lately, I've been having a lot of trouble keeping track of Andy's calendar. His student film audition schedule is crazy hectic.
Erin: Yes, there's Andy! Andy is in. I'm a good receptionist, I know he's in.
Andy: David Walrus, in his native habitat.
David Wallace: Hey, Andy. Can we go in your office and talk?
Andy: Yeah.
David Wallace: This isn't going to be an easy conversation. I told Andy that he was on very thin ice when he snuck away from three months to the Caribbean. Then last week he used company money to buy a top-of-the-line photo printer. In his words, 'The kind that's good for head shots.' And yesterday, he asked me to pay for cheek implants. Claimed it's gonna boost office morale. Now, he's a good guy. But honestly, at some point, the ice gets too thin and you fall through. And that is when you get fired.
David Wallace: Andy'
Andy: I'm gonna stop you right there. David, this documentary is going to air in two weeks. I feel like it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pursue my dream.
David Wallace: Uh-huh, but'
Andy: Every minute that I spend here is time not spent making audition videos for reality dating, cooking or singing shows. I got a real shot here. And I'll never be able to forgive myself if I blew it because I was too focused on my stupid paper company job. No offense.
David Wallace: So you think you've been too focused on your job?
Andy: At my last head shot sitting, I was so distracted wondering what I was missing at work that I came across totally manic. And I was going for zany.
David Wallace: So you'you want to quit Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting?
Andy: Well, no, actually. I see no reason to limit myself to just acting. I am pursuing fame of any kind. Could be singing, could be dancing. I don't'it just' I owe it to myself and my future fans.
David Wallace: Uh, well, I guess I can't stand in the way of a man's dream. And it seems like you have the gift.
Andy: Thank you, David.
David Wallace: There's probably no way I can talk you into staying at this point, can I?
Andy: Nope. I have made up my mind. I'm really sorry.
David Wallace: Well, good luck.
Andy: Thank you. Not gonna need it.
David Wallace: Okay.
David Wallace: Well that kind of worked out.
Creed: I think just anybody could be a star. My postman, the night janitor here, but Andy? No, definitely not. Charisma black hole.
Jim: Oh, Clark. I'm actually here today. Surprise! So I was wondering if I could maybe have my desk back.
Clark: Right. Yeah. But, you know, I've actually been working pretty hard here on a daily basis. So, I kind of feel like I've earned this. I mean, you know?
Jim: You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that I'm here.
Clark: Right. Well, I'm here to sell paper.
Pam: Wow.
Clark: All right, Jim, look, I just got made junior salesman. Right? And'and Wallace is here today. And I don't him to just think of me as a customer service rep that sits in the annex. I mean, you can get that, right? Right? And what do you need more face time with Wallace for? You trying to get a second second job here?
Pam: it's okay. You can sit in the annex.
Jim: What?
Pam: I'll come visit you.
Jim: Okay. The annex it is. I'll be sitting at your desk if that's okay with you.
Clark: That's fine with me. But be careful, it is very easy to get lost in Pete's beautiful, dead eyes.
Andy: Everyone, a little breaking news for ya. Just had a little chat with David Wallace. And, um, I'm taking a leave of absence from Dunder Mifflin, forever.
Oscar: I can't say we didn't see it coming. But it's a sad day when anybody is fired. We're so sorry, Andy.
David Wallace: Uh, uh, uh, uh, Andy was not fired.
Andy: I wasn't fired. What are you talking about? I'm fired up, yes. Guys, I'm'I'm leaving to pursue my lifelong dream of being famous.
Pam: Oh, Andy.
Andy: Yeah, so, I'll see you on the red carpet. See, that's how it works.
Phyllis: Andy sings beautifully. And he's really good at dancing. He's a good speaker. But there's just something there you don't want to look at.
Jim: Hey, how am I doing as your desk mate, by the way? You probably miss Clark.
Pete: Yeah, a little bit.
Jim: Oh, wow. But, um'Oh, I get that.
Pete: Oh, no, no, no. No it's cool.
Jim: I get it.
Pete: It's cool, man. I'm sure you and I will have our own thing.
Jim: Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You don't watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
Darryl: I just think you're going into this a little fast.
Andy: I'm 38, Darryl, how much slower should I go?
Darryl: Show business is cold. Let's say you get a job, which you probably won't. They're not gonna cut you any slack. You're meant for a job with lots and lots of slack.
Andy: All right. I get it.
Andy: The male is a funny species. We don't just tell each other how we feel, that's chick stuff. So instead of saying, 'Hey, Andy, I love you, man. I don't want you to leave.' You say something like, 'Hey, Andy, you're making the worst mistake of your life. You're not talented.' Well' right back at you, Darryl.
Andy: [hugs Darryl] I'm gonna miss you too. Mmm!
Stanley: Andy's from the generation that thinks they should all be famous. What happened to the generation that knew you shut up, did your work, and died quietly from a heart attack?
Kevin: Could Andy make it as an entertainer? I don't know. You know who's really funny? This bird, in the park, that can't fly right. I'd pay to see him. But I don't have to cause the park is free!
Sensei: I will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts.
Dwight: He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Sensei: It's not a large room, I think they heard me.
Dwight: Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself. [thrusts hips at Ira]
Sensei: That's really ok. I'm mostly focused on the belt here.
Dwight: Just slip it off my'Slip it off my hips.
Sensei: Hold it'Take a step back. Take a step back. [they bow, then Dwight thrusts again] Okay, okay. I can't'I can't do this if you're gonna be thrusting like that, okay? I think we're gonna have to cut this off.
Dwight: He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Angela: Dwight has been practicing karate for years. When we were dating, I would help him with his strength training. He would strap me to his chest in a baby Bjorn made for fat children and do lunges across the farm. It felt like I was flying.
Dwight: There it is. [everyone applauds]
Sensei: Congratulations.
Dwight: We did it, we did it. I love you.
Sensei: Okay.
Dwight: Thanks. I will now perform my final kata forms. You're gonna watch me right?
Sensei: Yes, I will. [Dwight starts doing karate]
Dwight: Sensei, you're not watching.
Sensei: Yeah, I'm watching. Just do it.
Dwight: Watching?
Sensei: I'm watching.
Dwight: Watch this part, okay?
David Wallace: Sensei, do you generally do house calls like this?
Sensei: Uh, you can just call me Billy. And no. No, but Dwight insisted. He wanted to receive his black belt in the place he loves most in the world.
David Wallace: He said that? He's an odd guy, isn't he?
Sensei: Yes. Irritating, also yes. But I gotta hand it to him, he's one of the most tenacious and determined men I've ever met. [Dwight finishes his routines and everyone applauds]
Esther: Oh! I'm am so proud of you, Schru-berry blue.
Jim: I really felt like I almost lost her, and'and nothing is worth that.
David Wallace: Well, I gotta tell you, Jim, a lot of guys in my circle? They wouldn't even change their golf schedule to shore up their marriage let alone their professional goals.
Clark: Dude, there is no way that Jim is just back here to hang out with Pam.
Dwight: You did not just say that! You don't know Pam. She is really cool.
Clark: All I'm saying is, forget about my chair. He wants the manager's chair. And I thought you wanted that job.
Dwight: Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. It's out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. I'd be happy to see Jim as manager.
David Wallace: So, the reason that I called you in here is because Andy is moving on.
Jim: Again.
David Wallace: Again! And I'm looking for a new manager. And with his performance this year, I have been considering Dwight. Am I crazy?
Jim: Not at all. It should be Dwight.
David Wallace: You sure?
Jim: You're gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uh'
David Wallace: Yeah.
Jim: Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely don't want to meet that person.
Nellie: Andy, we just wondered if we could have a word.
Andy: It's now or never.
Nellie: Well, we just had a quick question about this decision of yours. You know, to leave a stable job and pursue a career in the entertainment business. In your late 30s. With no savings to fall back on. And no real connections in that business, which can be competitive.
Andy: Yeah, sure. What's your question?
Kevin: Our question is'it seems dumb.
Andy: Well, it's better than sticking around here and half-assing it, right?
Nellie: Of course. But what if you were to stay here, you know, and 'full-ass' it? Um, really give it a go. Be the greatest manager in the history of this branch and in that way achieve the fame and immortality that you seek. Hmm?
Andy: Nah. I like my plan better.
Kevin: Well, Andy, your plan sucks, okay? Nobody is going to hire you ever. You're too character-y to be a lead and you're not fat enough to be a great character actor.
Andy: What?
Oscar: No, I don't think that he can make it as an actor. But, he also can't make it as an employee in an office, so why not go nuts with it?
Jim: Hey, are you still in charge of office supplies?
Pam: Yes. Yeah.
Jim: I seem to have sticky not emergency where I grab it on the wrong end, and this happens.
Pam: Oh, boy. Um'
Jim: If you could help me out, that would be'
Pam: I could give you some beginner stickies?
Jim: Anything would help.
Pam: Here you go.
Jim: Oh, also, while you're at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Jim: Wow, that's'
Pam: It's all yours.
Jim: You come so prepared. Aspirin.
Dwight: You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Jim: Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. It's really great.
Dwight: Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the manager's job?
Jim: No. He was maybe thinking of you for it.
Dwight: Yeah, right. I'm afraid that ship has sailed.
Jim: I wouldn't be too sure about that. Just saying.
Dwight: Hello.
Andy: Well, hello.
Dwight: Big day for you.
Andy: Big day for you.
Dwight: Thank you.
Andy: Love the belt.
Dwight: Oh, yes.
Andy: You know, I don't know anything about karate but I have broken a few boards in my day. Diving boards, at my family pool in Redding. I was an obese child. I never talk about that here, but Nard-dog's outta here, so letting it all hang out!
Dwight: This is exciting! You're finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Andy: Thank you, I appreciate that. 'Cause a lot of people are saying I might not make it.
Dwight: Oh, I doubt you'll make it. Very few do who've tried to be a star. But, listen, you've saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
Andy: No, I just applied for more overdraft protection.
Dwight: Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, don't quit your day job.
Andy: [cockney accent] Nothing is impossible to him who will try. [normal] Alexander the Great, if he were cockney.
Dwight: You're bad.
Andy: I'm gonna make it. Every person that has been on Conan has a crazy story about how they made it. Every person.
Andy: Erin. Honest Erin, cannot tell a lie. We lay together. That's something you can't take back.
Erin: So true. Is there a question, or are'what?
Andy: Will you tell me bluntly, do you think I am making a terrible mistake quitting my job to become an actor?
Erin: Bluntly? Yes. Huge mistake. Andy, honestly, I think you might become homeless. Or maybe even starve.
Andy: Thank you. [steps into conference room]
David Wallace: You can stay on as a salesman, Andy.
Andy: Thank you. [leaves]
David Wallace: Dwight, could you come in here for a second, please?
Dwight: Say it again.
David Wallace: Will you be the new manager?
Dwight: Where?
David Wallace: Where?
Dwight: What branch?
David Wallace: Here. Scranton. [Dwight falls to his knees] Come on. Come on, Dwight. Get up. Let's go. It's good news.
Dwight: I'm sorry. I've just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun.
David Wallace: What?
Dwight: But this isn't interim manager. No. It's Dwight K. Schrute' [pulls a business card out of his wallet] Manager.
David Wallace: Why do you already have this?
Dwight: In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.
David Wallace: I know.
Dwight: I will never, ever let you down.
David Wallace: I know, Dwight. I know. [reaches out to shake Dwight's hand, Dwight hugs him] Okay. Okay. All righty. You're gonna do great.
Pam: Hey.
Jim: Wow, hey.
Pam: Hi.
Jim: What's up?
Pam: Um, I have a question.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: Oh, I had a question.
Jim: Really?
Pam: I did!
Jim: Yeah, totally you did.
Pam: Super important.
Jim: I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: All right? I'm gonna wait.
Pam: All right. I did not come back here just to see you.
Jim: I'm sure you did not. What was your question?
Pam: I don't know, but it might take me a long time to figure it out.
Jim: Well, then, I should figure out things to do while I'm waiting.
Pam: Exactly.
Andy: Hey, everybody, I changed my mind. Not leaving. I'm gonna stay on in sales.
Nellie: Oh, thank god. Because sales could be your best role yet.
Meredith: Hey, good choice, man. Seriously. Don't want to see you in a porn next year.
Andy: Okay.
Kevin: Ooh, there's a great play about a salesman.
Andy: Death of a salesman.
Kevin: I don't think so.
Andy: Sure, 'Death of a Salesman' by Arthur Miller, it's a great play about crushed dreams.
Kevin: No, this one was written by Spongebob Squarepants.
Andy: [sits at Dwight's desk] Got any hot leads?
Pete: See, so you just push from under, and turn it around, and boom. No the staple crimps outward.
Erin: I had no idea. And here I've been stapling the same way for 20 years like a frickin' sheep.
Jim: Look who's back.
Pam: I'm back. Oh, hey, look, and now it's like a double date.
Pete: Wow. Cause, uh [gestures to him and Erin and then to Pam and Jim with sound effects]
Erin: Actually, maybe we should go on a double date some time. That'd be fun.
Pam: Yeah, we should do that for real sometime.
Erin: Well, how about Thursday?
Pam: Oh, well, Thursday's tough, because of'
Jim: Weeknights are actually tough just because'
Pam: They are.
Jim: That's true, yeah.
Erin: Just forget it. Forget I said anything.
David Wallace: Attention, everyone, just a quick announcement. Little reconfiguration to the staff. Dwight Schrute'
Dwight: David. Can I just do one thing while you're making this announcement and then I'll never, ever do it again?
David Wallace: I don't think so.
Dwight: It's just one thing. Just let me'let me do this'
David Wallace: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Come on'what I was about to say was Dwight'[phone buzzes] Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta'This'll be a second, sorry.
Dwight: Just wait and send it to voicemail.
David Wallace: Yeah.
Dwight: Come on. Come on.
David Wallace: [on phone] Then we'll get him a new set of drums.
Dwight: [climbs up on desk] Dwight Schrute is manager! [everyone cheers and applauds]
Andy: Brava, brava.
Creed: [from atop his desk] Creed Bratton is the new manager! [nobody responds]
Pam: What's going on?
Kevin: Dwight's the new manager. He freaking did it.
Pam: [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, Dwight.
Dwight: Pam.
Jim: [hugs Dwight] Congratulations, buddy.
Dwight: Thank you, Jim.
Clark: Congrats, Dwight.
Dwight: Get out of Jim's seat.
Clark: But I fought for this seat.
Dwight: You're an annex kid. You might be bullpen, we'll see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
Pam: It's nice to have you back.
Dwight: So'
Jim: So.
Dwight: I wanted to offer you a new position.
Jim: Let's hear it.
Dwight: Assistant regional manager.
Jim: Nope. Can't accept that job. It's not a real job.
Dwight: Jim.
Jim: I'll tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one I'd be proud to take.
Dwight: Shake on it? Done. Way to negotiate, idiot.
Jim: Don't get me wrong, I am definitely here for Pam. But this is an awesome added bonus.
Dwight: So, all the numbers adding up?
Oscar: Hey, I didn't get a chance to say it, but' congratulations, Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you.
Angela: Yes. Congratulations.
Kevin: Yeah, and Dwight, I'd like to be the first to say congratulations.
Angela: This is a big day for you.
Dwight: Yes, it is. Carry on.
Andy: How did I just abandon my dreams so quickly? It's cause I had a fallback. That's the problem. When you have fallbacks, it's just easy to give up. When Cortez landed in Mexico, only way he got his men to defeat the Aztecs was by burning all of his own boats. So they could never return home. Huge dick move but very effective. I need to be that same kind of dick to myself.
Andy: Everyone! Changed my mind again.
Phyllis: What's it now, dream or no dream?
Andy: Uh, dream. Goin' with my dream. Gotta go all in, isn't that right, Jim?
Jim: Oh, don't look at me cause I think you're making a terrible choice.
Andy: All in! Whoo!
Andy: Toby! Hey, I changed my mind again. I am gonna leave Dunder Mifflin to pursue acting after all.
Toby: Okay, then, Andy.
Andy: Yeah, but here's the thing. I can't have good old Dunder Mifflin to fall back on or else I'll never succeed. Gotta burn those boats! So I need you to go into my file and put down that I was fired for theft and/or groping wieners.
Toby: Andy, you know I can't do that. It'd be lying.
Andy: Seriously?
Toby: Yeah, I'm'
Andy: Come on, just do it.
Toby: I can't.
Andy: All right, fine, just know that you made me do this. [starts touching Toby's thighs]
Toby: [fending Andy off] Oh, come on. Andy, no.
Andy: God, Toby, don't'stop blocking my hand.
Toby: No, no.
Andy: This is your'you brought this on.
Toby: No, no. Andy.
Andy: Okay, all right. Groped you good. Off to Hollywood!
Angela: [answering phone] This is Angela. Oh. Hello, Miss Polodnikovski. Uh, how can I help you? Did my rent check not clear? Because I just transferred another $25 to that account. So if there's a problem it's clearly on your end. And'oh. Oh. Oh, okay. Good. Then... um' what is this about? No, no. Hey, hey! No, you are out of line Miss Polodnikovski. No, no you are. No you are! Evicted? Fine! I didn't want to live in that cesspool anyway! Listen, I get my security deposit back. Yes, I do. This is not fair! That is not fair! Well, you know what? You have so many hairs on your chin that Animal Control should've taken you away. That is very unladylike! You are disgusting! [hangs up phone]
Kevin: What do you think that was about?
Andy: David. I lost the Scranton White Pages account. Do you have any idea how much paper that is? And I'd just like to point out, I was mad at Dwight. I did it out of spite.
David Wallace: We put the past behind us, though, Andy.
Andy: What if I told you that I hate you and I hate this company?
David Wallace: Enough, Andy. Enough!
Andy: Just stop forgiving me, David, please? This is my last chance to honor what is best inside myself. What if I took a dump on your new car?
David Wallace: Oh my god.
Andy: Eleanor Roosevelt once said 'the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.' [clip of him flipping off David Wallace] I think she's right. [clip of David Wallace yelling at Andy to get out] I feel calm now. [clip of Andy taking a dump on a car] I feel, like, for the first time in a long time, I'm doing the right thing.
Angela: Andy.
Andy: Yeah.
Angela: What are you doing?
Andy: Uh, heavy stuff like books on the bottom. So it don't squash my knickety-knacks on top.
Angela: Yeah, okay. That's not what I mean. You don't have to leave because you said you would. Don't let pride ruin your whole life. Okay? It's not worth it.
Andy: Wow. Angela. What we had was great, and, honestly I think about it a lot too'
Angela: Ugh.
Andy: But I just'it's in the past. And I feel like we shouldn't'
Angela: No, that's not'
Andy: Rehash'
Angela: No, none'No, stop. It's just'
Andy: Exactly.
Angela: Okay. Well, have a good trip. Good luck, Andy.
Andy: Thanks, Angela. You too.
Angela: Thanks.
Andy: A-bridge, a-burnt. No turning back now. Everybody, Lorelai and I would like to say thank you and goodbye the only way we know how.
Nellie: Oh, good lord.
Stanley: Can't you just leave?
Jim: You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
Andy: Tuna, I'm a performer. And perform I shall. [sings 'I Will Remember You''everyone is slightly impressed]
Dwight: [whispering] You okay?
Angela: [crying] It's just a really nice song.
Kevin: [everyone applauding] Awesome!
Phyllis: Who knows? Maybe Andy will make it. He's not terrible.
Stanley: Yeah. And people worse than him make it all the time. Like Lil Romeo.
Phyllis: No, he's good.
Stanley: He was good.
Oscar: Good night, Kevin.
Kevin: Night, Oscar.
Oscar: Tents? Are you thinking of going camping? I thought you found nature vulgar.
Angela: Well, I've changed my mind.
Oscar: Wait a minute. You're not thinking of living in a'
Angela: Oh, god, could you just mind your own business?
Oscar: Okay, I'm just gonna say this. You are not going to live in a tent.
Angela: Oh, god.
Oscar: Come stay with me.
Angela: You don't want me at your place.
Oscar: I do. Yes. Not forever. But until you get back on your feet. Which won't be long. It's the least I could do.
Angela: Well'
Oscar: Separate bathrooms.
Angela: Thank you.
Oscar: You're welcome. Let's go get Phillip. Then we'll get your stuff'
Angela: Okay.
Oscar: And get you the hell outta that place.
Angela: Are you allowed to have pets?
Oscar: Oh, Angela.
Dwight: Yesterday I was just your average, ordinary paper salesman with a farm and a bunch of pipe dreams about beet fuel. Today, I leave here a regional manager with a black belt. It really is amazing how your life can change in one day.
Darryl: You talk to Wade and Colin?
Jim: No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? What's up?
Darryl: We got an offer on the table.
Jim: What kind of offer?
Darryl: A buyout.
Jim: What?
Darryl: We're in play, baby.
Jim: Oh, my god!
Darryl: We did it! Hey, and look, the buyers wanna make sure it's not just a Philly play, so get this: they're gonna pay for us to go pitch out west. We talking Spurs, the Jazz, Cowboys. Blake Griffin, baby.
Jim: Wow, that is' wow.
Darryl: Yeah, we did it.
Jim: Yeah, we did. Hey, how long'how long do we think that's gonna take?
Darryl: Wade said we could do the whole country in three months.
Jim: Oh, man. Yeah, I can't do it.
Darryl: Can't do what?
Jim: This, man. I can't do this to Pam.
Darryl: No, no, Jim. This is different. This is everything.
Jim: I know. And I can't do it.
Angela: So is your place all bachelor-slobby and gross?
Oscar: No, it's neat and tasteful, like most gay men's homes. The stereotype holds up.
Angela: I wouldn't know. I never lived with a gay guy.
Oscar: Angela, you just were'
Angela: [starts sobbing] I love him.
Oscar: I know. I understand more than most, but we both have to move on. You'you can't'
Angela: No, not the senator. I love Dwight.
Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Kevin: But the coffee in Peru is much hotter. [Erin buzzes him into the office]
Dwight: Last week I finally became permanent manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton. My first project: increase security. I got these doors from a jewelry store that had recently gone out of business. Now they're protecting America's real treasure, paper. Every morning I email the day's security codes. Something that's been really missing from my life has been writing secret codes. It's not the KGB, but it's a start.
Erin: The tea in Nepal is very hot.
Dwight: But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Erin: Close.
Dwight: This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
Erin: Colder.
Dwight: The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
Erin: No, I meant you're getting colder. The correct response is, 'the coffee in Peru is much hotter.'
Dwight: Ah, much, ok.
Erin: But, that's three wrong, so I gotta give you the steam. [Dwight begins to protest] Unless you want me to break protocol?
Dwight: No, no. Give me the steam.
Dwight: It's just harmless steam to panic intruders. I'd like to get harmful steam, but the prices are absurd.
Dwight: [while getting steamed] Break protocol! Break protocol! Break protocol!
Creed: [carrying in clothes on hangers] Oh, I'm saving a fortune on dry cleaning.
Philip: Mama!
Oscar: Angela, someone wants you.
Angela: Ok, coming. Hi, baby.
Oscar: Angela's divorce from the senator has been very difficult for her. When she got kicked out of her apartment, I invited her to move in with me. Ironic that it's Angela who's living in the closet. Hey-o.
Oscar: Saddle shoes. With denim? I will literally call child services.
Esther: Go get 'em, honey.
Dwight: Oh, don't worry. They'll get got.
Dwight: Manager of Dunder Mifflin? Check. Owner of a 1600-acre beet farm? Check. Engaged to be married to an actual milkmaid? Check' on that later today. This is my grandmother's ring. It was made from a bullet I took out of her left buttock. She was a moonshiner shot by Adolph Coors. This is my grandmother's buttock bullet ring.
Andy: Hello, good morning. My name is Andrew Bernard. You might know me from a TV documentary that's premiering tonight. I also killed it in local theater and I am fresh off of a hot industrial flick.
Check-in guy: Ok, thanks. Go ahead and get in the back of the line.
Andy: Yes!
Andy: Well, burned all my bridges at Dunder Mifflin, and time to become the next American Idol. By winning America's Next A Cappella Sensation. On channel TBD. It's a really cool show, it's like a revision of the whole American Idol, Voice, Sing-Off phenomenon. On this show, all three judges are mean!
Jim: Sales form for you to sign.
Dwight: You know what to do. [waits for Jim to put form in inbox, signs it and returns it to outbox] Ok
Dwight: Behind every great regional manager is a great assistant to the regional manager, and I have chosen one of the best.
Jim: Aw, thanks, man.
Dwight: Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but we've overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War'
Jim: No.
Dwight: Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Jim: Pre-conference room meeting with Dwight went really well.
Pam: Oh, bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.
Jim: All depends on the conference room meeting itself. [phone chimes] Uh, okay.
Pam: Is that them again?
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Maybe you should call back?
Jim: I will. I will.
Jim: The guys at Athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing. Meeting athletes on their home turf, building relationships. Yeah, it sounds exciting. But I said no, and that's final. I almost lost Pam over this business. I'm not risking that again.
Pam: When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.
Dwight: Welcome.
Jim: He welcomes you.
Dwight: Please take an agenda item.
Jim: Your agenda-taking pleases him.
Dwight: Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. 'Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.' [buzzer sound] That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Jim: Let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if you're expecting a fax today, please don't yell out, 'Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future.' Ok? That's nonsense.
Pam: Question.
Jim: Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Pam: We are expecting a water delivery today at 10am. What if, as they're delivering the water jugs, someone screams out, 'Nice jugs'?
Jim: That's obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Everyone: [overlapping] Zero. No nonsense. You can't have nonsense.
Dwight: [as Angela enters with Phillip] What is going on?
Angela: Daycare won't take Phillip anymore.
Oscar: Why?
Angela: Apparently my station in life has descended to a depth even they won't forgive. So, hi.
Oscar: Hi, buddy.
Dwight: Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
Jim: Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Who's excited?
Meredith: I'd better come out of this smelling like a rose. I've been on my best behavior for nine years. If it wasn't for the cameras, I would've done some truly vulgar crap.
Stanley: Over the course of this documentary I've had three affairs. If you find my body in a ditch, let me save the police some trouble: my wife did it.
Dwight: I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.
Kevin: Ooh, announcement! Some of us whose televisions got broken during an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial will be watching tonight at Poor Richard's. But note, all are welcome, not just those whose saw an all-you-can-eat shrimp commercial and charged their televisions.
Oscar: I can't believe the doc is finally going to air. When this thing started, I was still having sex with women. As was Kevin, I believe.
Creed: This airs tonight? Oh my god. If my parents see this, I am toast.
Andy: This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang 'I Dreamed a Dream' from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.
Casey: Whoo-hoo! Casey Dean! Cincinnati, Ohio! [singing] Doctor, doctor, gimme the news, I got a great Casey Dean for you.
Andy: No!
Casey: America wants it!
Andy: No, this is my time! You don't belt on my time! I belt on my time.
Casey: [singing] Casey Dean!
Andy: [vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!
Casey: Man, those are some nice pipes.
Andy: Yeah.
Casey: What's your name?
Andy: Andy. What's yours?
Angela: Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
Oscar: Why didn't you pack the apple snacks?
Kevin: Guys.
Angela: Because whenever I pack the bag, you say I do it wrong.
Kevin: Guys.
Angela: Why don't you pack it?
Kevin: Guys.
Angela & Oscar: Kevin, what?
Kevin: Do you want to see a video of a weatherman who says 'bold front' instead of 'cold front'? It's insane.
Angela: Not now, Kevin. Can't you see we're busy? Phillip needs his apple snacks.
Oscar: Seriously, Kevin. I'm just gonna have to go to the store.
Angela: Ok, you go to the store.
Kevin: Philllip, Phillip, Phillip. It's all about Phillip. I hate Phillip.
Dwight: Not now! Private time!
Jim: I love Star Wars as much as the next guy'
Dwight: Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]
Jim: My god, I'm so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.
Dwight: Which is, of course'
Jim: Potential future nonsense.
Dwight: Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Jim: I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager.
Dwight: The power source.
Jim: Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
Dwight: A loyal, but bungling apostle.
Jim: But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Dwight: Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
Jim: Exactly.
Dwight: I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Jim: Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests.
Dwight: I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Jim: Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
Dwight: That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard.
Casey: What're you listening to?
Andy: Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.
Casey: Oh, sweet.
Andy: A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.
Mark McGrath: What's up, everybody? And welcome to America's Next A Cappella Singing Sensation!
Casey: Ah! It's Mark McGrath! Oh my god! You're gorgeous!
Mark McGrath: Thank you, thank you so much. And thank you for your patience. And we hope to see you guys within the next five to seven hours. Now, just to give you a couple parameters of the show, each of you will sing a song for thirty seconds, after which our judges will decide if they want you in their a cappella group. Now, each group will start with 90 singers, which will compete in a series of singing and physical challenges. Oh, and look out for that pesky mole!
Andy: There's a mole?
Mark McGrath: Oops. I'm not supposed to'I'm not supposed to say that. All right, no mole. Forget I said it, all right?
Andy: What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.
Mark McGrath: Good man right there. I'll see you guys inside. Good luck, all right?
Andy: Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!
Casey: What? On a roll much?
Andy: I don't know where it came from.
Casey: That was amazing, man!
Andy: Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.
Casey: Yeah, you made a personal connection with him.
Andy: I did, I felt it.
Casey: Big time.
Pam: What are you so excited about?
Jim: Nothing.
Pam: What are you up to?
Jim: Members of the office, hear ye.
Dwight: That means ye, Plop!
Pete: Plop? Still?
Dwight: We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Pete: Fine.
Jim: Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Erin: Aw, heck ya!
Pam: Nice.
Dwight: You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
Jim: This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring.
Dwight: Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
Jim: He envies you.
Dwight: You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it.
Jim: Alright.
Jim: By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.
Darryl: What up?
Glenn: What's going on? How was the delivery?
Darryl: Delivered all my furniture to Philly. Hey, keep it down, though. Nobody knows I'm here.
Darryl: I hate goodbyes, so last week, when I left Dunder Mifflin for good, I pulled the old Irish Exit. Just slipped out without making a big deal. No hard feelings. No feelings at all.
Jim: A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?
Meredith: Uh, two.
Jim: 985,000,000,000,017.00
Dwight: Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
Jim: Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Pam: Theme song from Saved by the Bell.
Jim: Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Dwight: Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job.
Jim: That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Pete: A horse.
Jim: Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
Pete: What's the opposite of a horse?
Jim: Come on.
Jim & Dwight: Sea horse.
Jim: Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna'
Jim & Dwight: Say that? Uncanny.
Jim: Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?
Clark: Yeah.
Jim: Do you want a corn dog?
Clark: I would love a corn dog.
Jim: We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Clark: [reading] Mr. Halpert, your wife called to find out how your meeting with Yuri Big Nose went.'
Dwight: No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations.
Jim: Uncanny.
Soldier: I just hope that if my buddies who are still in Afghanistan see me win, they'll feel like anything is possible.
Andy: Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.
Casey: Over at the porta-potties, they were interviewing a homeless, single mother with three kids.
Andy: What?
Casey: Yeah.
Andy: Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?
Casey: I don't know. But I'm getting really worried here.
Andy: Me too. Hold my place in line.
Casey: Where are you going?
Andy: They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.
Darryl: Thanks, man.
Hank: Thank you.
Darryl: Yep. Take care.
Pam: Darryl, hey.
Darryl: Hey.
Pam: Cool, are you coming back to say hi?
Darryl: No, no, I'm not here actually. These donuts are part of my escape from the guys at the warehouse I didn't say goodbye to.
Pam: Aha. How's Athlead?
Darryl: We livin' like rock stars. I'm about to eat free steaks with my sports heroes in 32 different cities.
Pam: Wow.
Darryl: Jim really doesn't want to come?
Pam: He says he doesn't want to.
Darryl: Wow. Man. I hope he doesn't regret it.
Pam: Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.
Darryl: Jim is happy here, selling paper at Dunder Mifflin?
Pam: That's what he says.
Darryl: If you say so. Hey, good seeing you. Remember, I was never here. All right, then.
Jim: An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?
Dwight: A thousand times more.
Phyllis: I'll try this one.
Jim: Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.
Phyllis: [grabbing the coffee] Hot!
Jim: Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
Dwight: [over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
Jim: Look at that form.
Dwight: [running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!
Jim: Uncanny. [everyone applauds]
Erin: Darryl?! Darryl!
Kevin: Whoa.
Darryl: Oh, hey. Hey, what's up, y'all?
Erin: You left us without saying goodbye.
Darryl: Oh, my bad. Goodbye, everybody.
Meredith: Hey! No way!
Kevin: That's totally uncool.
Erin: Are you kidding? You broke our hearts. Get upstairs.
Darryl: I don't think I sh-
Erin: Get upstairs, mister!
Meredith: Yeah!
Kevin: Right. Now.
Darryl: Guess I'm going upstairs.
Jim: You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing'none of these people are good enough.
Dwight: I know.
Jim: What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said.
Dwight: Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Jim: Is-
Dwight: Me.
Jim: The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight: Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.
Jim: I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That's it. You look really, really good.
Dwight: Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?
Jim: Hey.
Pam: Hey.
Jim: You all right? What's going on?
Pam: Are you happy?
Jim: Yes, I'm happy.
Pam: No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: And that was fun. But what about a year from now?
Jim: What?
Pam: What about five years from now?
Jim: Pam.
Pam: Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just'I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much.
Jim: This was my decision, not yours.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: You didn't force me.
Pam: I kind of forced you to do it.
Jim: You did not force me to do this.
Pam: Yes, I did.
Jim: I don't know how else to tell you.
Pam: I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that'
Jim: Resent you?
Pam: This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you.
Jim: Is that really what you think?
Jim: Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys.
Camera Crew: Okay. You got it, man.
Darryl: I didn't realize we were this close.
Phyllis: We're all a little hormonal with the doc airing.
Meredith: Are you gonna come to Poor Richard's and watch with us tonight?
Darryl: Uh' yeah. Depending on traffic.
Stanley: He ain't coming.
Erin: Oh, god!
Darryl: These dudes are definitely in a weird mood. Picked the wrong day to return a truck.
Darryl: Well, it's been great.
Phyllis: Eleven years. A guy is in your life for 11 years and then he's gone for who knows how long.
Darryl: Maybe forever. Anyhow'
Oscar: Did we ever have lunch together, just'just the two of us? You know what, I'm gonna make reservations right now at Cugino's.
Meredith: Question for Darryl. Did we ever get loaded and listen to Zeppelin in my van?
Darryl: Oh, oh, I'm sure we did.
Meredith: Nah, I call one hour van time with Darryl.
Clark: Darryl, you know, I would love to just record some of your stories, just let the tape roll for six or eight or ten hours and just see what we get.
Erin: Listen guys, we can do it all. We just have to divide Darryl's next 12 hours into 90-minute segments. I will go watch an eHow video on how to use Excel, and then we'll get this started.
Darryl: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Okay, I made the mistake of sneaking out of here and that's on me. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of the day here doing stuff with you cause you're feeling sentimental.
Meredith: You have to! [everyone grumbling]
Darryl: Hey, hey, hey. I'll do one thing with y'all.
Phyllis: Which thing?
Darryl: I don't care, choose amongst yourselves. Not the van though.
Angela: Kevin, Kevin.
Kevin: Oh, you know my name. Well, that is shocking. [continues making noise]
Angela: Kevin, could you not do that?
Kevin: What? I'm moving the ink down in my pen, for work.
Oscar: Here, use my pen.
Kevin: Don't tell me what to do!
Angela & Oscar: Shhh!
Kevin: No, I don't need this! And you obviously don't need me.
Angela: Kevin, where are you going?
Kevin: Away. Tell Phillip that his stupid little baby wish came true.
Oscar: He just won't go down. It's as if he's excited by all this paper.
Angela: I know. Earlier today he tried to eat some of the 24-weight letter bond.
Dwight: Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.
Andy: Hey, what's goin' on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young'uns?
Casey: You're back!
Andy: No, it's me, Andy!
Casey: No, I know.
Andy: No, no, no. I'm wearing makeup.
Casey: You did a really great job. You even look shorter.
Andy: Oh, I took out my lifts.
Casey: Oh.
Andy: Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.
Casey: Oh.
Esther: All day long, it's moo the cows and cluck the hens. Get the sheep baa-ed. Oink the pigs.
Dwight: Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]
Esther: Dwight, I'm telling you about all the things that ma said after the horse kicked her in the head. Where are you? Dwight?
Dwight: The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.
Dwight: [puts his grandmother's ring away] Thank you, Esther.
Esther: Bye.
Jim: You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Dwight: I need you to perform a test.
Jim: Perform a test.
Dwight: On an innocent baby.
Jim: Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz.
Dwight: Damn straight.
Jim: Unless you think he can't handle it.
Dwight: Hey, he can handle it.
Jim: All right.
Oscar: [holding Phillip] Listen, listen. Shh, buddy. Stanley's sleeping. You don't want to wake up the grumpy old walrus, do you?
Stanley: I heard that.
Phillip: Mama.
Dwight: Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Pam: He does have a gift.
Oscar: Well, he's calling for his mom, but, okay, here, here you go. Careful, he bites.
Phillip: Mama.
Dwight: Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager's office before?
Dwight: Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called 'Schrute or Consequences.' You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?
Phillip: Beet.
Dwight: Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
Check-in guy: Sorry, folks, the judges are totally swamped. We are all done taking auditions.
People in line: Oh come on! Hey!
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Check-in guy: But thanks for coming out and be sure to watch America's Next A Cappella Sensa'
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't do that. You can't do that, we've all been waiting.
Check-in guy: Okay.
Andy: I am going in there! Don't'
Check-in guy: No, you're not, sir.
Andy: Don't'don't'
Check-in guy: Please don't.
Andy: Don't touch me.
Check-in guy: I'm not touching you. Okay? [Andy makes a break for it]
Casey: Run, old man! Run! Run! Run for your life! Get off. Don't you dare. Don't get'I could see it. You were gonna get handsy with me. Not interested. I'm Casey Dean! You'll be seeing the last of me. Er, I meant you won't be seeing the last of me!
Oscar: Hey. Did you manage to feed him? I don't know what it is. He just keeps spitting out the nipple.
Dwight: That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Kevin: He's not that smart. He doesn't know where I hid his duck.
Andy: [interrupting contestant singing 'Beautiful' by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You're still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You're like, my three favorite people ever.
Santigold: What is this?
Andy: [shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you're amazing, okay? You're obviously gonna be on the show, so it's someone else's turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I'm just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.
Aaron Rodgers: No, you're a middle-aged man with a lot of makeup on.
Andy: Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.
Clay Aiken: No, we do not want to hear you sing.
Santigold: Gabriella was our last audition. Thank you. Goodbye.
Andy: Nope! Can't end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss's car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.
Aaron Rodgers: Flag on the play.
Andy: That's'that's what'yeah. Okay, all right, well, here's the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga's waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater'
Santigold: What is this song?
Andy: Are you insane? It's the Cornell fight song.
Clay Aiken: Listen, all right, thank you very much, we're not interested.
Andy: You didn't let me finish. That's not fair.
Aaron Rodgers: Look, man, you're not terrible. We've heard a lot of really good singers today and you're just not good enough.
Andy: Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that's the show. Let me try a different song, okay?
Aaron Rodgers: Can he do this?
Andy: [singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you're never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges' reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly'
Santigold: Look, you gotta go. [Andy falls to his knees, sobbing] You can't just sit here and cry.
Andy: Oh I can so just sit here and cry!
Jim: [addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.
Oscar: Hey, Kev, how you doing, buddy?
Kevin: Can't hear you. I'm giving you the silence treatment. How does it feel being ignored?
Oscar: Okay, I guess, it's just that Phillip got you something.
Angela: Yeah, a $25 gift card, iTunes.
Oscar: I think there's, like, $7 left.
Angela: It's just his way of saying, 'Thanks for letting me hang out in Accounting.'
Kevin: Phillip got this for me?
Oscar: Sure.
Kevin: That was a really cool move.
Angela: Would you like to hold Phillip? [hands off Phillip] Yeah. That's Kevin.
Kevin: Whoa.
Oscar: Easy.
Kevin: What a chubbers. Whoa.
Angela: Okay, watch it.
Kevin: I'm losing my balance.
Angela: No, Kevin, no.
Oscar: Hey, no.
Kevin: Whoa!
Oscar: No horseplay.
Angela: Stop it.
Kevin: You wanna play with the cactus?
Angela: No, no!
Kevin: So, me and Phillip were just talking and we decided we're gonna be best friends. He's a little standoffish at first. But once he starts buying you things, man, you can tell he likes you.
Erin: We have our decision.
Darryl: You chose one thing?
Erin: We want to dance with you.
Darryl: You want to dance?
Erin: One dance, all of us together.
Darryl: This is what you want?
Erin: Absolutely.
Darryl: Better get some decent speakers up here then, cause we're gonna do this right.
Erin: Yes! [Stanley, Creed, Meredith and Creed all cheer]
Angela: Hey. You wanted to see me?
Dwight: Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.
Angela: I am sorry he's here today but I had'
Dwight: I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Angela: How thoughtful.
Dwight: Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.
Angela: If he is your son, that's a great plan. But he's not. He's not your son.
Dwight: Very well.
Angela: Can I go back to my desk now?
Dwight: Yes.
Pam: What is this?
Jim: Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.
Dwight: Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
Jim: OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
Dwight: [throws 'now' beanbag at Jim] Now.
Jim: I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.
Dwight: Jim. I'm not kidding. I need you.
Pam: Go ahead.
Jim: Ok, um, this is' [leaves DVD with her]'I'll be right back.
Jim: What do we got?
Dwight: I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Jim: Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step.
Dwight: She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest.
Jim: Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.
Dwight: Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Jim: [whistles] That's a lot of pros.
Dwight: And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Jim: So what is the problem?
Dwight: Angela.
Jim: I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.
Dwight: Some sort of virus?
Jim: Love.
Dwight: Oh.
Jim: Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.
Dwight: You're a good assistant, Jim.
Jim: Not as good as you.
Dwight: That's very true. Get the hell outta here.
Jim: You got it.
Jim: You watched it.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: Well, then I guess you're ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]
Pam: What's that?
Jim: It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.
Pam: Thank you.
Erin: Ok, everybody ready?
Phyllis: Hit it, red! ['Boogie Wonderland' by Earth Wind & Fire plays as Darryl dances with each member of the office]
Darryl: I wanted to leave quietly. It seemed dignified. But having Kevin grind up on my front while Erin pretends to hump me from behind is a more accurate tribute to my years here. I'm gonna miss these guys.
Oscar: Ok, I've got my'
Meredith: See you guys at Poor Richard's, all right?
Oscar: All right, Meredith.
Angela: Okay, bye.
Oscar: See you there.
Kevin: Bye, Phillip. High five.
Oscar: Yay! I am gonna drop Phillip off at my mother's, and I'll meet you at Poor Richard's in an hour.
Angela: Are you sure you don't want me to drop him off?
Oscar: She doesn't know I'm living with a straight woman. I don't want to get her hopes up.
Angela: All right. Bye, buddy. Bye, bye, bye!
Oscar: Oh, my goodness.
Dwight: [in bullhorn] Pull over!
Angela: Dwight?
Dwight: Move to the side of the road!
Angela: Why?
Dwight: Pull over!
Angela: What do you'Dwight! [Dwight cuts her off in his car, they pull over]
Angela: [getting out of her car] Dwight! What the [bleep] is your problem!
Dwight: [on bullhorn still] Shut up, woman!
Angela: Who drives like that?
Dwight: Listen to me! I love you! And I don't care that Phillip's not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Angela: Can you put that down?
Dwight: This expresses how loudly I love you.
Angela: It's too loud.
Dwight: [puts down bullhorn and kneels] This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
Angela: Okay, yes'yes, I will! [they kiss] I love you!
Dwight: I love you!
Angela: And I lied to you.
Dwight: What?
Angela: Phillip's your son.
Dwight: What? Why would you say that'
Angela: I just needed you to want to marry me because you wanted to marry me.
Dwight: [excited] Get out! I'm a dad!
Angela: You're a dad!
Creed: Hey, grab a seat. We have that table and that table, but not that table or that table or that table. Floor's up for grabs. Meredith has been hogging the can. [Dwight kisses Creed's head] Oh!
Erin: You have to change the channel to PBS.
Kevin: Yeah.
Bartender: College baseball is on.
Erin: But there's a documentary coming up. Everyone in the bar will love it.
Bartender: What's it about?
Erin: A paper company.
Bartender: How many people want the game? [half the bar cheers] Who wants PBS? [other half cheers] Sorry. Tie means I do nothing.
Kevin: Sir, please. This show is about me and my attempts to find love in all the wrong places.
Andy: One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers]
Bartender: All right.
Kevin: Yes!
Clark: Hey, how was the singing show audition?
Andy: Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.
Creed: Ok, thirty seconds to showtime!
Kevin: I feel scared a little.
Phyllis: Yeah, I'm not ready for this.
Stanley: No one is ready for this. You can't be ready for this. We don't even know what this is.
Oscar: One thing we do know, nothing will ever be the same.
Jim: Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of 'Pilot']
Dwight: The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?
CameraMan: We're getting bonus footage for the DVD.
Dwight: pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.
CameraMan: It'll be a pledge gift.
Dwight: PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.
Dwight: In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a 'where are they now' panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go.
Dwight: [mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.
Kevin: Yes! Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Stanley: Ah, I've been looking forward to this day since I was 18 years old.
Meredith: Speech!
Dwight: No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake is'for'Kevin.
Kevin: Yes! Wait, why?
Dwight: Go ahead and just read the frosting.
Kevin: 'Get out.'
Dwight: Uh-huh.
Kevin: What does that mean?
Dwight: It's a colloquial way of saying 'you're fired,' Kevin, which you are.
Pam: What? Dwight, you can't do that.
Dwight: The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.
All: What?!
Dwight: Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.
All: Dwight'[overlapping objections]
Dwight: Based'on his merit.
Oscar: Ooh.
Jim: Umm'.
Kevin: I'm'good.
Pam: Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so'
Toby: Yeah. Yeah, I don't think'
Dwight: Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.
Kevin: [crying] At least I got chocolate.
Jim: I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too.
Jim: Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.
Crowd: Whoo! Yeah
Jim: [to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?
Jim: And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.
Pam: [whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?
Angela: [whispering] Yes. My heart is so open, I am so at peace. [scoffs] Look at Meredith. She's disgusting. Those feet. They're like the paws of an orangutan.
Pam: I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much.
Dwight: That is all. Have a good morning.
Meredith: Thank you.
Dwight: [after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?
Angela: [laughing] To remind you that our wedding's gonna be wonderful.
Dwight: Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.
Angela: D, it's gonna be perfect. The only people that need to be there are you and me.
Dwight: Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.
Angela: I don't'I don't know why.
Dwight: I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band 'The Grass Roots' in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.
Phyllis: Oh, some fudge?
Malcolm: Oh, thanks. I love your fudge.
Phyllis: Thanks.
Malcolm: I think I gained a couple of pounds since I got here.
Phyllis: [laughing] Oh, you can afford it.
Phyllis: After 16 years, it's strange sitting across from somebody who isn't Stanley. But'he'll get there.
Jim: Okay, the limo's gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready 'cause I want to pack in a lot.
Zeke: Party time! Whorehouse!
Jim: Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?
Zeke: Well, you're the bestisch mensch.
Jim: Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight'only good surprises. 'Guten Pranken'. [chuckles]
Dwight: Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight.
Clark: Great, now we got three hours to fill.
Jim: Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?
Dwight: Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.
Jim: Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.
Andy: Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say
Casey Dean: You can't just sit here and cry.
Andy: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!
Andy: Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.
Bill Hader: [fake crying]
Seth Mayers: Oh, Don't. Aw, come on, Baby Wawa. Don't be such a baby.
Bill Hader: [crying and pouring eye drops in his eyes]
Seth Mayers: Oh, No. It's gonna be alright.
Bill Hader: [pulling multiple tissues out]
Seth Mayers: It's gonna be all right. For Weekend Update I'm Seth Meyers. That's Baby Wawa. Good night.
Bill Hader: [still crying] Bye!
Andy: After my clip blew up, I actually got a call from the double rainbow guy and the fat Star Wars kid. Turns out they have a support group. [pause] Not really my scene.
Oscar: [on the phone] Years ago, the senator promised a left turn lane by the Arby's. So I wanna know where in the name of horsey sauce is it? Well, yeah, you'hold on.
Dakota: Hi. I keep seeing this symbol in the accounts from last year. It's..it's all over the place. I don't know what it means.
Oscar: That's the reason Kevin got fired. It's his magic number. He used to use it to balance his accounts. He used to call it a Keleven. He told Dwight, [imitating Kevin] 'A mistake plus Keleven gets you home by seven.' He was home by 4:45 that day.
Nellie: Oh, I live in Poland now. The Scranton of the E.U. Thank you for flying me out here for the weekend. I'm looking forward to the reunion panel tomorrow. Can't wait to see everyone. Well, almost everyone.
Toby: Hello! [laughing] Hello!
Nellie: Oh.
Toby: Hi! [goes to hug Nellie]
Nellie: No.
Toby: Oh. [laughs nervously]
Nellie: How did you now my plane had arrived? How long have you been stalking me?
Toby: Oh, no, no. no. My plane just got in. From New York. Are you still with Piotr?
Nellie: No. And I thought I unfriended you.
Toby: Anyone can follow a Twitter feed. Wanna share a cab?
Toby: [alone in cab} After Dwight fired me, I moved to New York to write the great American novel. I have six roommates. Heh. Which are better than friends, you know 'cause they have to give you one month's notice before they leave.
Andy: Hey-OH!
Meredith: Andy?
Oscar: You're back?
Andy: Yeah.
Malcolm: [whispering to Phyllis] That's Baby Wawa, right? Oh, my God!
Jim: Hey man, good to see you.
Andy: Thank you. Yeah,
Phyllis: [hugging Andy]. Andy'
Andy: Hey! Aw! A bear hug from my favorite mama grizzly.
Phyllis: Andy, I've been worried about you. How are you?
Andy: A little warm.
Phyllis: Poor, poor Andy.
Andy: [struggling] Okay. Aw. Thank you Phyllis.
Darryl: Hello, hello.
Jim: Hey!
Meredith: Darryl!
Andy: Hey!
Darryl: Hey, what's up?
Andy: Didn't I just see you at the airport jumping in a limo?
Darryl: What? Must've been another devilishly handsome debonair individual.
Andy: Hmm.
Darryl: Hey, man. How are you doing? I, um'I didn't call 'cause I figured you changed the number.
Andy: No I didn't change the number. All good though. Phone never rings.
Dwight: What? Ooh!
Andy: Surprise!
Dwight: I thought you guys couldn't come.
Darryl: Yeah, but then they moved the panel to the same weekend and the Doc crew paid to fly us in. It was kismet.
Jim: Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? 'Guten Prank' number one.
Darryl: You ready for tonight? We gonna tear up the town?
Dwight: Uh, better ask Jim.
Jim: And Jim will say nothing.
Pam: [enters] Darryl! Andy!
Andy: Hey! Pam!
Darryl: Hey, Pam! How are you?
Pam: We're fine. Yeah. [hugs both Darryl and Andy] And I'm sure that you guys are fine too. Because why wouldn't you be?
Andy: Mm-hmm.
Pam: Darryl, oh, my gosh. How is Austin? Tell me everything. How's the merger? I feel like I read about Athlead all the time.
Darryl: I love it. And it's Athleap now. And the city is amazing.
Jim: Yeah?
Darryl: Yeah. Yeah, it's hot. The music is awesome. And the tacos are'for real.
Jim: Wow! That sounds incredible. [checking cell phone]. Oh, guys. Limo's here. Let's do this. Change if you need to.
Oscar: Whoo, whoo, whoo.
Pam: Okay, you guys, have fun. You too, Andy.
Oscar: Yeah!
Andy: Aw!
Darryl: Woah-Oh! Haven't been in one of these in forever.
Oscar: They wanted me to go to the bachelorette party with the girls. Really? Such a clich. I'm a man. So I'm going to the bachelor party with the boys. I just have to remember how I acted before I came out.
Oscar: WASSUUUUP! [laughing]
Dwight: Wait, why are we stopping? Jim, this isn't on the itinerary.
Jim: Get out.
Dwight: Jim'wha' Come on! What'what are you gonna whack me, Jim?
Jim: No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking.
Dwight: A bazooka. You remembered.
Jim: Of course I did.
Dwight: [tearful laugh]. Get out of my way.
All: OH! [all laugh and applaud after Dwight fires the bazooka]
Dwight: Woo! Okay!
Jim: Yeah! [to camera] Guten Prank number two.
Jim: Private Room.
Oscar: Yeah, brosef.
Dwight: Amazing.
Jim: Enjoy, enjoy.
Guy: Hey, I know you. Are you gonna sit here and cry?
Jim: Okay, man, easy.
Guy: [fake cries]
Jim: Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?
Andy: Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral.
Darryl: That happens a lot?
Andy: Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.
Oscar: Well, I bet it was a smash.
Andy: That's how I got my new job in the admissions office.
Oscar: Is that a volunteer program or'
Andy: No. It's a job. Things are going great.
Darryl: Let's get a drink in you, huh?
Andy: Yes.
Meredith: Whoo-hoo. Let's get this party started!
Rachel: Where's my angel.
Angela: This is my big sister Rachel.
Rachel: No, this is my big sister Angela.
Angela: [laughs] We're very close. We even have our own special language.
Rachel: [speaks in a special language]
Angela: People love it.
Rachel: They do.
Dwight: [sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?
Stripper: Hi, boys!
All: Ohh'
Clark: Here we go!
Dwight: Oh, Thank God. We are famished!
Stripper: Hey, did somebody order the chef special?
Darryl: Right there.
Dwight: No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]
Stripper: I bet you boys have a big appetite.
Dwight: Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.
Stripper: Mm, I know what you want. I know exactly what you want.
Dwight: Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?
Stripper: Ohh, shh. [places finger over Dwight's lips]
Dwight: Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.
Erin: Whoo!
Angela: What? [knock at the door] Okay.
Pam: Oh, boy.
Erin: Oh!
Jakey: Heard you guys needed some pipes fixed or cleaned or whatever.
Phyllis: Angela's special repairman is here.
Angela: Wait, what is this?
Meredith: Shut up. Jakey?
Jakey: Mom?
Pam: Wait, wait. What?
Jakey: Oh, man.
Meredith: No, no, no, no. Just do your wok. Pretend mom's not here.
Pam: Uh, that seems inappropriate.
Meredith: Give the good show, my little entrepreneur.
Jakey: Okay.
Meredith: Take it off. [music play]. Yeah! Good song choice, Jakey. Stripper's only as good as his song.
Rachel: oh, wowee wow.
Angela: Okay'
Pam: Whoo-hoo'go, Meredith's stripper son.
Angela: Rachel, are you all right?
Rachel: I don't know!  I don't know.
Angela: Oh geeze. [Jakey starts dancing on Angela]. Oh, my God!
Meredith: Be gentle Jakey. Gentle. One second. Just one second. Look. [pushes Jakey aside and starts dancing on Angela]
Angela: Okay, if anything, this is rougher. Stop it Meredith.
Meredith: Fine. My bad. Go ahead Jakey.
Angela: [Jakey resumes dancing] Uh, no. It's o'thank you. You know what? You don't have to'oh no, no, no. No, no, no. It's okay.
Dwight: Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic.
Clark: Dwight, for the last time, she's not a waitress.
Dwight: You're telling me!
Oscar: If you want her to leave, just tip her.
Dwight: What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?
Angela: That was interesting. [creaking sound] What was that?
Phyllis: It's just the wind.
Angela: Will you lock the door?
Phyllis: Okay. [opens door] It's just the wind, see? Nothing.
Angela: Alright, see, you don't have to leave the door wide open. We get it. It's the wind. Just come and shut'[Mose grabs Angela and takes her away] OH! My God!
All: [screams]
Erin: Phyllis!
Rachel: What's happening?
Dwight: Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]
Jim: Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.
Dwight: Good old Mose. [laughing]
Jim: They think it was Mose.
Dwight: Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.
Oscar: What is that?
Dwight: A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.
Jim: Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?
Dwight: Right. Which one is that?
Jim: Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?
Jim: Is that Mose?
Dwight: Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!
Mose: Well, first, buy us a drink.
All: If you want your bride, buy us a drink! If you want your bride, buy us a drink.
Dwight: Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.
Kevin: Well, well, well, well, well, well. That's six 'wells.' Did I get that number right, Dwight?
Dwight: I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.
Kevin: Yes. I did. This one. Now get out!
Dwight: [to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim]
Jim: Ooh.
Dwight: You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.
Jim: Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.
Dwight: Waste of a good hatchet.
Jim: Okay, just talk.
Kevin: Well, w'
Dwight: I heard you say 'well' the first time.
Jim: I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.
Dwight: It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.
Kevin: You're just saying that to make me feel better.
Dwight: No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.
Kevin: Is that all it was?
Dwight: That's it.
Kevin: Come here [hugs Dwight]
Dwight: I missed you Kevin.
Kevin: I missed you!
Dwight: Ohh.
Mose: Guten Prank.
Jim: Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.
Dwight: You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?
Dwight: Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]
Angela: What the [bleep] is your problem you [bleep] [bleep] [bleep]?!
Jim: Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or'
Dwight: No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.
Jim: Right.
Stanley: Hey guys.
All: Stanley!
Erin: How's Florida?
Stanley: Oh, great.
Stanley: Yes, I'm living in Florida now. Little town called Florida City, just on the edge of the everglades. The man who delivered my divorce papers came by fan boat which was kinda fun. I sit on my porch all day, carving birds.
Jim: Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?
Pam: No, no, I'm fine.
Jim: Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.
Stanley: I guess this was work being filmed nonstop for nine years.
Andy: I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.
Kevin: [watching at his bar] People actually dance to this. It's in my juke box. None of the money goes to Andy though.
Kevin: [laughing] Yeah, people hate you.
Andy: I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall]
Man: Hey! It's Andy Bernard!
All: Nard Dog! [cheers and claps] Ree-De-De-De-Doo! [repeats]
Andy: Ree-De-De-De-Doo!
Man 1: How did it feel to see your lives played out on tv?
David Wallace: It's like seeing a documentary about how your food is made. It's kinda disgusting. You learn a lot, but I didn't wanna know any of it.
Dwight: With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.
Pete: Uh, no one recognizes me. But not all my friends call me Plop. So' thanks PBS.
Woman 1: Uh, Jim, that DVD in the last episode was so romantic. And, um, I think we'd all love to know, Pam, what romantic thing did you do to pay Jim back for leaving Athlead?
Pam: Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something.
Jim: She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.
All: Awww.
Jim: O-Kay.
Woman 2: All I can say is, if I had Jim, he would have a free pass to do anything. I mean if I lucked into that' he could do anything. Anything.
Pam: [pause] I'm sorry. Is there a question?
Woman 2: Uh, no.
Man 2: Pam, what was in that teapot letter?
Pam: Oh, um, well, you know, I' I just' I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.
Man 2: I hear ya. What did it say?
Moderator: We're gonna move on. Next question please.
Man 3: Do you find that your life feels pointless now that nobody's actually filming you anymore?
Toby: Yes.
Woman 3: I wanna know how everyone felt they were portrayed. Was it accurate?
Meredith: I got a beef with that. Um, for the first seven years, I was getting my PhD in School Psychology and they didn't show it. Yes, I was getting hammered but, hey, it was college.
Woman 4: I have a question for Jim and Pam. Everyone watching sees how much you love each other and how you're soul mates. So, Pam, how could you doubt that when Jim moved to Philadelphia?
Jim: Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.
Pam: Listen, um' I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end.  And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.
Woman 4: Like Harry Potter.
Pam: Yeah, like Harry Potter.
Joan: I have a question for Erin.
Erin: Really?
Joan: Yes. Um, the thing I found most compelling about the documentary was your search for your birth mother.
Erin: Thank you.
Joan: So my question is, um, do' don't you hate her? I mean, I would just imagine that you were so angry at her that you would hate her.
Erin: Maybe sometimes. But not like 'hate' hate. More just like, 'Mom, I hate you!' And then she would say 'go to your room, young lady.' And I'd stamp my foot and run upstairs and I have a room, which is really cool. And then we'd just have dinner together. But I don't know. I'd have to meet her. Thanks.
Joan: Erin'
Erin: Yes?
Joan: Um'Oh, Erin..
Erin: Yes? Is there a follow-up question? [realizes] Mom? [they hug]
Ed: Erin' Same question but about your dad? [they hug]
Moderator: Well, this feels like a good place to stop. Let's thank all of our wonderful panelists for being here on this wonderful panel today.  [audience claps] Next week at the Scranton Cultural Center don't forget, Irish Step Dancing semifinals. Winning team to Mid-Atlantic. [applause and scattering cheers]
Kevin: Where's the, uh, basket for gifts?
Usher: Right there, sir.
Kevin: Okay.
Dakota: Hi, I'm Dakota.
Creed: Jeff Bomondo. I sell ceramic tile out of Newark.
Dakota: Nice.
Creed: My wife's name is Kathryn. I can show you my social security card if it helps.
Kelly: Uck, Look at all this mud. Can you imagine if I had worn my Jimmy Choos? I just saved you 600 bucks mister.
Ravi: Thanks for helping out, sweetie.
Ryan: Kelly, you're here.
Kelly: Hey, Ryan!
Ryan: Hey.
Kelly: Whose baby is this? Oh, are, like, a nanny now?
Ryan: No, this little guy is mine.
Ryan: So I was dating this girl, and one day, she went out to get a new charger for her e-cigarette. Never came back. Oldest story in the book. [baby squeals]
Ryan: Say 'hi', Drake.
Kelly: Drake is your baby's name?
Ryan: Yeah.
Kelly: That is an amazing name. I'm obsessed with Drake. His last album' it just touched me to pieces.
Ryan: No Kelly, he's no named after a hip-hop artist from 2011. It's Drake, like a mix of Drew and Blake.
Kelly: Cool.  Well, he is so cute. Ravi, check out this cute baby. I'm obsessed with him. Ravi is a pediatrician and some of his patients are total uggos.
Ravi: They're called premature, sweetie. It's good to see you again Ryan.
Phyllis: Let me help you us.
Angela: Thanks. [knees buckle] Oh. Ouch.
Pam: Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.
Angela: No, my heels aren't too high. It's because I spent three hours in a car trunk. Thanks for not locking the door when I asked you to, Phyllis. [sighs] Sorry Phyllis. You didn't know. As long as I can get to the altar.
Phyllis: Oh, I'm gonna get you to that altar. You can take that to the bank.
Jim: You ready?
Dwight: [chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars]
Jim: Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um' I don't know how to tell you this, but' we have a little bit of a problem.
Dwight: Oh, no. What?
Jim: The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.
Dwight: Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.
Jim: I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-
Dwight: Not' significant is a big word'
Jim: I think it's definitely' Well, okay. Either way'
Dwight: I think you're only a teeny'
Jim: Either way, Dwight' I can't be there for you. I'm sorry.
Dwight: Jim.
Jim: I just'really wish there was something I could do. [looks off]
Dwight: [turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can't believe you came.
Michael: That's what she said.
Jim: Best prank ever.
Minister: As it is traditional to the Schrutes, the lovers are standing in their own graves as a reminder that this is the only escape from what they are about to do.
Nellie: [to Joan] See, I get what they are trying to do, but why are the graves so shallow?
Kevin: [reading] 'Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. For lo, the winter is passed. The rain is over and gone. The time of singing has come and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice for your voice is sweet and your face is comely. '
Minister: I now pronounce you man and wife. [everyone cheers] Release the doves! [doves do not move right away]
Kelly: Oh.
Kevin: That's not'
Dwight: Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab 'em on in there.
Dwight: Everybody!
Jim: [dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don't owe me anything.
Ryan: Ravi? Ravi? Drake has a bit of a rash. And he's hot.
Ravi: Oh, no.
Ryan: I was wondering could you maybe examine him for a second?
Ravi: Oh, yeah, you're not feeling well little guy? Okay, sure. Should we go inside?
Ryan: Actually, could you go inside? I'm feeling a little dehydrated. I could really use a little break, have some water.
Ravi: Are you sure you don't wanna go in?
Kelly: Ravi, just do it. That baby is burning up. Isn't this, like what you live for? Just go. Go.
Ryan: Thank you Ravi. Thank you so much. This is great for me and for Drake. Thank you.
Kelly: I don't know, Ryan. Baby Drake didn't look so good.
Ryan: He'll be fine. I let me suck on a strawberry. He's allergic but he'll get over it fast. I had to talk to you.
Kelly: You gave your baby an allergic reaction just to talk to me? [they kiss]
Pam: Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.
Pam: [with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!
Pam: He just so happy to have a family plan.
Ed: Where'd you learn to dance like that?
Erin: I don't know. I've just always been really good at dancing.
Toby: [dancing with Pam] [sobbing]
Pam: Is it me? Is it Nellie?
Toby: [sobbing] It's everything.
Phyllis: [dancing with Stanley] I missed you.
Stanley: I missed you too.
Phyllis: Lots of people think that Stanley Hudson's a mean old grump. [laughs] But [crying] would a grump make this? It's me. It's me.
Ryan: I love you.
Kelly: [laughing] I love you too.
Ryan: We're gonna be together forever.
Kelly: We're running off into the sunset.
Ryan: I finally mastered commitment.
Kevin: [to Oscar] What was that stuff?
Ravi: Hey, has anyone seen Ryan' or Kelly?
Kevin: Ooh! Yes. Uh, They left together a little while ago. Kelly was hoping that you would keep the baby so they can start a new life together.
Ravi: Oh, that's it. Here. [hands Drake to Kevin] Call child services and report an abandoned baby. We'll find a better parent than Ryan in no time.
Kevin: Oh, I don't know.
Nellie: Um, Kevin? Oh, I can help you with that. Yeah. I mean, I can find someone who will' who will love that beautiful little boy the way he deserves.
Kevin: Hey, this is better. [hands Drake to Nellie]
Nellie: Yes. It is. Oh yes it is.
Nellie: If Ryan wants his baby back, please tell him where to fine me. We'll be somewhere in Europe. [looking at Drake] Won't we?
Michael: [crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.
Darryl: Thank you go much.
Dwight: Good night.
Toby: Good luck.
Val: Great. It was really fun.
Dwight: Good evening.
Val: The Doc crew's throwing a big after party in the warehouse tonight.
Darryl: Yeah, I heard. It sounds kinda lame. [to camera] No offense. You going, Toby?
Toby: Oh, I don't know. I might turn in early.
Andy: It's only 6:00. Come on, everybody's going.
Meredith: You have to go, Toby.
Pete: Yeah, come on, Tobes.
Val: Come on.
Toby: Yeah. I'll stop by.
Pete: There he is!
Pam: I need to get out of this dress.
Jim: I gotta get out of this dress.
Carol Stills: Oh, I'm sorry Pam.
Jim: What's going on?
Pam: [sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?
Carol: [whispering] I'm so sorry. They were an hour late.
Jim: No, really, what's going on?
Pam: Okay, Okay. Um' so' this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just' I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture' and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.
Jim: Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?
Pam: About 2 months
Jim: That's why it's so clean.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: I mean, you were gonna do this without me?
Pam: Well, you' you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.
Jim: Oh' okay. Where would we go?
Pam: Austin? Maybe.
Jim: I promise you, you don't have to do this for me.
Pam: I'm doing it for us.
Jim: The last'
Buyer: Okay. We'll take it.
Jim: [to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about'
Pam: Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?
Buyer: We wanna buy your house.
Jim: You wanna do this?
Pam: I wanna do this.
Jim: You really want to do this?
Pam: I really want to do this!
Jim: [hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!
Jim: Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]
Darryl: What? All right!
Pam: We're so excited.
Phyllis: Cool.
Woman: Oh, that's for PBS executives only.
Stanley: I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this.
David Wallace: I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I'd love to contribute to your campaign.
Oscar: Thank you David.
Pam: Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper',which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]
Pam: Everyone, Let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just'I kind of meant just everybody from the office.
Photographer: [taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that's great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody.
Jim: [whispering to Pam] Let's go outside
Pam: Okay.
Stanley: Okay, I need a drink.
Kevin: Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith's drawer] What the'there's only dandelion tea and raisins in here.
Meredith: Hey, bottom drawer.
Kevin: Yes!
Pam: [answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.
Pam: I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But'it would just'just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself 'be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long.'
Kevin: If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it's that if you film anybody long enough, they're going to do something stupid. It's only human natural.
Dwight: Hey guys.
Angela: Hi.
All: Hey!
Pam: What about the honeymoon?
Angela: Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again?
Dwight: Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?
Jim: You know what? Maybe we should talk.
Darryl: Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.
Kevin: What is it?
Andy: [on the computer] You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...
Pam: I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing'
Jim: Athleap.
Pam: And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially'
Dwight: No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!
Jim: Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note.
Dwight: Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.
Pam: Thanks Dwight.
Jim: Hey, and if you're ever in Austin...
Dwight: Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay'in my barn.
Jim: There it is.
Dwight: Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So' have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So'yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates.
Andy: [on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.
Kevin: Oh, Yes!
Darryl: You did good. Real good.
Andy: Thanks Dad'Darryl.
Andy: I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.
Oscar: You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It's not much. But if you see it in the right way'And that's what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn't once show me doing my origami.
Creed: [walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!
Creed: [playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn't matter. 'Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same'
Jim: Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes'and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's'an amazing gift.
Phyllis: Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.
Jim: Thanks Phyl.
Creed: I still have my medal from that.
Angela: Do you even have a mattress?
Creed: No, but I still have my medal from that.
Kevin: Oscar. Oscar. [crying] I think I'm gay.
Oscar: Why do you say that?
Kevin: [sniffles] It's just that I'm so emotional.
Oscar: Yeah, but you're not gay. You're not gay.
Kevin: No, but maybe the reason'
Oscar: You're not gay.
Creed: [still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before.
Erin: How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?
Darryl: Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?
Creed: It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But'[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let's do this.
Meredith: I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they're the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You're not alone sister. Let's get a beer sometime.
Phyllis: I'm happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down.
Jim: I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid'wonderful'boring'amazing job.
Pam: I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all'I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?
