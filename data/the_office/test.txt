Pam: I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...
Pam: [Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.
Delivery man: Would you sign here? [Phyllis gets up from desk and walks over.]
Pam: Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.
Meredith: Happy Valentine's Day darling. Love Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration.'
Phyllis: Isn't he sweet?
Meredith: Yeah. Wow.
Michael: Alright Dwight, as you know I am heading to New York today. [Dwight holds up passport.] Doing a presentation on the branch to the new CFO.
Dwight: And you want me to come with you.
Michael: Nope. The opposite of that.
Dwight: I will stay here and run things on this end.
Michael: Ok, good.
Dwight: Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
Michael: I probably will, why do you ask?
Dwight: Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: Screwed.
Michael: What
Michael: This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.
Michael: Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?
Pam: That's OK.
Michael: Alright.
Oscar: The best present would be, you do a good job in front of the new CFO.
Michael: Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
Michael: Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.
Jim: So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.
Dwight: What's this? What is this?
Jim: I dunno, it's on
Dwight: Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?
Jim: It was there when I sat down.
Dwight: [opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!
Michael: The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]
Jim: Hey Kelly. What's up?
Kelly: Nothing. Oh except, oh my God Jim. Last night, Ryan and I totally, finally hooked up. It was awesome.
Jim: OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]
Kelly: And it was so funny 'cause we were at this bar with his friends and I was sitting next to him the whole night and he wasn't making a move, so in my head I was like 'Ryan, what's taking you so long?' And then he kissed me. And I didn't know what to say.
Jim: Wow.
Kelly: So I said, 'Ryan, what took you so long?' And I just said that to him, can you believe that?
Jim: Wow.
Kelly: Oh my God, Jim, is that embarrassing? I'm embarrassed.
Jim: No, don't be.
Kelly: Oh, thank God, because I was nervous, Jim, you will not believe.
Jim: I bet.
Kelly: So nervous, but now -- now I have a boyfriend.
Jim: Alright. [Kelly squeals]
Ryan: [anguished] I hooked up with her on February 13th.
Michael: Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.
Kevin: Woah. [Delivery man with flowers]
Pam: Guess what?
Phyllis: Really, Oh, they're from Bob again.
Pam: That's great. [Meredith scowls]
Michael: Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.
Michael: This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.
Dwight: Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.
Angela: Really? I wouldn't know anything about that, but I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Dwight: Oh I did. I did.
Angela: I didn't get anything for Valentine's Day.
Dwight: Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.
Angela: Really? Well, I hope I do.
Michael: I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.
Jim: [on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.
Kevin: Woah, woah [Delivery man with oversized bear]
Delivery man: Phyllis Lapin.
Pam: OH, Holy God!
Delivery man: It's from Bob.
Kevin: Man, that thing's bigger than I am.
Delivery man: No, it's not.
Kevin: Oh zip it.
Michael: There they are. What's up? Hey hey.
Craig: Hey.
Josh: Michael Scott. [sticks out hand for handshake]
Michael: Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.
Josh: You know Dan Gore from Buffalo.
Michael: Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]
Craig: What's up buddy?
Michael: You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
Craig: Guilty, yeah.
Michael: So what's going on? What I miss?
Josh: Not much, they're uh, I guess running late upstairs, so we're just waiting for the presentations.
Michael: Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]
Dwight: Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?
Pam: You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.
Dwight: No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]
Pam: You need to get something for your girlfriend.
Dwight: [same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...
Pam: Tightly wound?
Dwight: (smirking) Exactly.
Pam: Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.
Dwight: You mean, like a ham?
Pam: No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.
Dwight: Ok, I get it.
Pam: That you remember her.
Dwight: Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]
Josh: What about you, Craig, you lose anyone?
Craig: Oh man, Jan, called me in September and said 'You gotta fire four people,' and I was just like, 'What?' Ya know?
Josh: Did you?
Craig: No, I just ignored her. She's the worse.
Josh: She is our boss.
Craig: She ain't my boss dude. I don't work for that bitch.
Michael: Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
Craig: What? You like Jan? How can you
Michael: Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
Josh: You hooked up with Jan?
Michael: You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
Josh: Yeah, let's change the subject.
Michael: Yeah, yeah.
Kelly: I don't know what he's thinking, but I would just be so psyched if we just dated forever.
Jim: Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]
Ryan: Soda.
Kelly: [to Ryan] Cool. Hey, so... do you want to... do something tonight? Or...
Jim: [under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Kelly: I mean, I know it's Valentine's Day, or whatever, but there's totally no pressure at all, of any kind. What so ever. So...
Ryan: I can't tonight. I have plans with my friends.
Kelly: OK, That's cool. I completely understand.
Ryan: Cool. Cool. OK.
Jan: Josh Porter, Stamford.
David: David [to Josh and shakes hands]
Josh: Nice to meet you.
Jan: And Michael Scott, Scranton.
David: Nice to meet you.
Michael: Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?
Jan: Fine Michael. Thank you.
David: OK. So we are in the process of doing a complete review of the company's financial strengths. All I'd like to do today is to...
Jan: Nervous, no I'm not nervous. Well, I guess I'd be lying if I didn't say I was a little nervous. Umm, the new CFO is judging me on this too, and well, it is Michael, so. Yeah, I'm very nervous.
Josh: So with the twelve new local accounts, we had a total of four percent organic growth, which was just above our pre-year targets.
David: Thanks very much.
Josh: Thank you.
David: OK, Michael.
Michael: What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]
Michael: [video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
Michael: Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.
Michael: [video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']
Michael: Questions?
David: Wow. OK, OK, thank you Michael, that was great.
Michael: Yes, thank you.
David: But, for right now what, I would really like to know about is the branch's performance, so do you have that information as well?
Michael: Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]
Delivery man: [with flowers] Can you sign?
Pam: Yeah.
Pam: [delivering plant to Oscar's desk] Oscar.
Angela: Nothing for me?
Pam: [walks away] Join the club.
Kevin: Whose it from? [to Oscar]
Oscar: My mom. [puts card in pocket]
Kelly: It's frustrating, because we'd be so perfect together.
Jim: You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.
Kelly: Yeah, it would be so great if he was.
Jim: Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Kelly: Okay, cool. Is it okay if I invite Ryan? [Jim leaves]
Dan: And that about does it, thank you.
Jan: OK. [looks toward Craig] Craig,
Craig: Yeah. Here's the deal. I did not understand this was supposed to be a full on... like report or whatnot.
Jan: Um, I'm sorry, what did you think financial presentation meant?
Craig: I was under the impression this was, more of like... a meet and greet type deal.
David: So, does that mean you don't have the numbers on your branch?
Craig: That is correct, yes.
Jan: Craig, you realize that we're trying to decide whether if drastic steps need to be taken?
Craig: Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Jan: Well, the point is, is that doesn't exactly bode well for your branch.
Craig: Oh man, you know what? Michael made that stupid movie, he doesn't get into any trouble? Maybe I should have slept with you, too. [David looks at Jan, who glares at Michael.]
Michael: Oh, ok. Alright.
Jan: NO, NO I'm not, I'm not, I just... I just don't know what to do anymore, Michael. I mean, we're all gonna get fired.
Michael: No you're not.
Jan: Yeah, Michael - the CFO thinks that we slept together. Do you understand, people get fired for much less? And I just [scratches head] can't believe that you told everybody and we didn't even sleep together.
Michael: Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
Jan: Oh, God. Michael. It was months ago. It was once, It's over. Do you understand?
Michael: Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
Jan: Surely, you cannot be serious?
Michael: I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
Dwight: Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.
Roy: Hey babe.
Pam: Hey.
Roy: You almost ready to go?
Pam: I guess, yeah.
Roy: What's wrong?
Pam: Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.
Roy: What, you're mad at me?
Pam: I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me
Roy: Well, Valentine's Day isn't over. Let's get you home and you are gonna get the best sex of you life.
David: You understand this is a very serious situation.
Michael: No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]
David: You made a joke?
Michael: I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]
David: Well I don't need to explain to you that even a joke about sexual relations with your boss...
Michael: I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
Jan: Uh, that's fine. Let's just forget it.
David: Good. [Michael leaves office]
Pam: Heading out?
Jim: Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.
Pam: Bye. [Jim leaves]
Phyllis: Goodnight Pam. [Leaves with oversized bear on back.]
Pam: Night Phyllis.
Jan: Oh, Michael. Thank you again for that, really. It was very nice.
Michael: Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
Jan: Oh, no, it's OK. [Puts hand in way of elevator door to stop from closing.] So, uh, Happy valentine's Day.
Michael: Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]
Jan: Oh.
Michael: Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]
Michael: Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.
Pam: Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'
Michael: I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.
Michael: I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.
Pam: You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?
Kevin: Not really, my fiance is out of town.
Pam: Where is she?
Kevin: I'm not sure. Arizona? Sometimes she doesn't tell me.
Pam: Cool.
Michael: That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.
Oscar: Happy Valentine's Day, Meredith.
Meredith: Thanks.
Creed: Okay, you take it easy, ace.
Oscar: Here you go, Creed.
Creed: Hey, thanks, ace.
Creed: I'm not good with names.
Michael: This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.
Phyllis: I'm gonna go call Bob.
Vance Refrigeration Worker #1: So, what are you doing for Valentine's Day?
Pam: I'm gonna spend it with my fiance.
Vance Refrigeration Worker #1: Okay.
Pam: What are you guys doing?
Vance Refrigeration Worker #1: Probably go grab dinner with my girlfriend. He's gonna be pulling his pud watching Skinemax. [points to Vance Refrigeration Worker #2]
Pam: Nice.
Dwight: Okay, okay. That's enough.
Phyllis: Hey.
Dwight: Come on, break this up.
Receptionist: Yes, sure. Mr. Scott, you can head to the conference room. The other managers are already there.
Michael: Great. Thank you.
Receptionist: All right.
Michael: Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.
Dwight: How do you spell 'animalian'?
Jim: Animalian?
Dwight: Yes.
Jim: Why?
Dwight: None of your business. I'm writing something.
Jim: You're writing something?
Dwight: Forget it. I'll look it up myself.
Jim: Okay.
Dwight: No, you know what? You do it.
Jim: No, I'm not gonna do that.
Dwight: Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.
Jim: But I know how to spell it.
Dwight: So tell me.
Jim: Only if you tell me what you're writing.
Dwight: Forget it. I'll do it. But you're getting written up.
Jim: So now you're writing two things?
Jim: Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.
Kevin: [phone ringing] Hi, this is Kevin. Stacy? Happy Valentine's Day. Yeah. Oh, awesome. Okay. Yeah, I'll be leaving here soon. Cool. I love you, too. Okay, 'bye. Stacy's back.
Oscar: That's great, man.
Devon: Hey Scott. Hey. Hey! Hey! Come here! Come here! I want to talk to you. Come here!
Michael: You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.
Michael: Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...
Dwight: They are either going to say yes... or no.
Michael: Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Dwight: Think it through.
Michael: Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
Jim: Can we not?
Michael: No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
Jim: Still want that.
Michael: Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
Creed: Ryan!
Dwight: Fumble! Yaaah!
Michael: Hey, Dwight.
Dwight: Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Michael: You all right Ryan?
Dwight: Ryan.
Ryan: Yeah.
Michael: Pam!
Dwight: Ooh. They're having a sale on TiVo. Maybe I should get a TiVo. Oh. DVD Burner! Maybe I should get one of those. You are so lucky, Jim. You are so lucky you don't have this problem. What was the 9th place prize again? A loaf of bread?
Jim: Cugino's pizza.
Dwight: Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?
Jim: Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...
Jim: What did I do to deserve this?
Pam: Are you sad that Dwight beat you?
Jim: No.
Pam: Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?
Phyllis: Hey, I heard you got a wedding dress. Do you have pictures?
Pam: Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.
Phyllis: Oh.
Jim: Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Pam: Ok, cool.
Pam: I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.
Michael: That's what she said!
Dwight: Ha! I don't get it.
Michael: Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Dwight: Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Michael: Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
Michael: Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.
Dwight: What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'
Michael: That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
Dwight: When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.
Dwight: I can't do this.
Michael: That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
Dwight: Oh, okay.
Michael: But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
Dwight: Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
Michael: Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
Dwight: I'll try and think of one. When...
Michael: Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
Dwight: Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
Michael: Insult.
Pam: Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...
Jim: Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?
Jim: I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.
Jim: Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...
Oscar: I get here early every morning so I can set the thermostat. I like it a little cooler, around 66 degrees. I'm more productive. Maybe some people don't like it as cold as I do, but I don't care.
Michael: [stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Dwight: Saleswoman has a vagina.
Michael: It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.
Dwight: But I'm right?
Michael: Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
Dwight: Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
Michael: I do. Both of them.
Dwight: Could I have a copy of one of them?
Michael: No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
Michael: Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael: [generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.
Phyllis: Unbelievable.
Michael: You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.
Dwight: That is so great about the bonus!
Michael: No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
Stanley: Go ahead. Get the wallpaper. Wallpaper the ceiling if you want. Call Terri and tell her she...
Phyllis: It's unbelievable!
Dwight: Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Pam: Do we know anyone who was in the accident?
Dwight: Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.
Stanley: Why would this affect our bonuses?
Dwight: They are unrelated.
Kelly: Is Brad okay?
Dwight: He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
Oscar: What the hell is going on here?
Angela: Are we out of jobs?
Dwight: Yes.
Kelly: This is karma because of what he did to Jennifer Aniston.
Michael: He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
Stanley: Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
Stanley: You said we were getting bonuses.
Michael: All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
Stanley: Cancel wallpaper.
Michael: As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.
Pam: You mean Toastmasters?
Michael: Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Pam: Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?
Jim: Can I go?
Michael: Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
Jim: So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Kevin: You should go to Hedonism.
Jim: What is that?
Kevin: It's like Club Med, but everything is naked.
Jim: I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
Toby: Been to Amsterdam.
Michael: Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Toby: [mimes lifting a glass] To Amsterdam.
Jim: When did you go there?
Toby: Umm... After my divorce. Yeah.
Jim: Really for like how long?
Toby: Uh, about a week. Er... .um... .maybe a month. I uh can't...
Creed: Jimmy, listen to me. You do not want to go to Amsterdam. Trust me.
Jim: Where do I want to go?
Creed: I'd send you to Hong Kong.
Creed: Like to say 'Hi' to my friends in China. [speaks in Chinese]
Michael: Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.
Dwight: Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
Jim: No. We're not.
Dwight: Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Jim: Which means absolutely nothing.
Dwight: Michael, can you explain?
Michael: Well, it's mostly made up. So...
Michael: Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.
Michael: Confidence, Dwight.
Jim: Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?
Dwight: I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.
Jim: Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Dwight: Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
Jim: You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Dwight: You did?
Jim: Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
Dwight: Yes. I am.
Jim: The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
Dwight: Which is?
Jim: You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
Jim: Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.
Jim: Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own
Dwight: I'll glance at it.
Michael: It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.
Angela: The very best of luck to you, Dwight.
Dwight: Thank you, Angela.
Kelly: Why'd you pick the V.A. for the reception?
Pam: Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.
Ryan: You're inviting Jim?
Pam: Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
Michael: All right. You ready? Here we go! Wow. It's a little bit bigger than I remember. Come on. We're down here. Right.
Overhead: [song] You all ready for this?
Angela: [coughs] [sniffles] I am just feeling under the weather. And... I think that I will go home and rest.
Kevin: I've never, ever seen you take a sick day.
Angela: Well, I've seen you take enough for the both of us.
Speaker: Next, I'd like to introduce the Dunder Mifflin Salesman of the Year, Dwight Schrute!
Crowd: [polite clapping]
Michael: Dwight, they called your name.
Speaker: Dwight, how we doing?
Dwight: No, I can't... I ca...
Michael: All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!
Crowd: [claps]
Michael: Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Kevin: I always set it at 69. [snickers]
Pam: Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.
Kelly: But he did a great job. June 10th is perfect. I want a June wedding.  I've always wanted one. Ryan, do you know when you would want to get married?
Ryan: Actually, I don't see myself ever getting married.
Kelly: Oh.
Pam: Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...
Ryan: I know what I said.
Michael: I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?
Michael: Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.
Crowd: [clapping]
Michael: Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
Dwight: [bangs fists] Blood alone moves the wheels of history! Have you ever asked yourselves in an hour of meditation, which everyone finds during the day. [waves arm] how long we have been striving for greatness? [bangs fist] Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered. It has been a lifetime's struggle [waves arms]. A never-ending fight. I say to you [hits podium] and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
Crowd: [clapping]
Dwight: WE ARE WARRIORS!
Crowd: [clapping and cheering]
Dwight: Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
Crowd: [clapping and cheering]
Dwight: [laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!
Oscar: I've got a time share in Key West that might be available.
Jim: Maybe. Thanks.
Ryan: You really think you're going to go?
Jim: Yeah. I'm definitely going.
Ryan: Nice. Send me a postcard.
Ryan: Jim has worked at the same place for five years. Jim eats the same ham and cheese sandwich everyday for lunch. I don't know. If I were a betting man, I'd say he will have a fun weekend in Philadelphia.
Dwight: No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists]
Crowd: [claps]
Dwight: Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is...
Crowd: [shouts] Together that we prevail! [cheering and clapping]
Pam: Australia? I have always wanted to go there?
Jim: I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
Pam: That's awesome. Where are you staying?
Jim: I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...
Pam: When are you leaving?
Jim: I'm... leaving on June 8th.
Pam: Oh.
Jim: Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...
Pam: Oh yeah. That's too bad.
Jim: Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Pam: It's ok. I got it.
Jim: Alright.
Dwight: Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?
Michael: I got thirsty. How'd it go?
Dwight: It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
Michael: You would not believe what happened here.
Dwight: What? Something happened?
Michael: Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
Dwight: Weird.
Michael: Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
Dwight: Con artist.
Michael: She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Michael: Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?
Dwight: My future is so bright, Jim. Jim, do you know how bright my future is? It's so bright that... What? Do you know? Is there something I got to wear? Huh?
Jim: Goggles?
Dwight: [imitating '80s rock]
Dwight: And what a lot of people don't understand about sales is that it has so much to do with organization. I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to, when I speak to them and what we have discussed. Etcetera.
Michael: That's it? You're going to end with 'etcetera'? Okay, what's this big organizational system that...
Dwight: Well, do you think I should describe our filing system?
Michael: That would be suicide. Never, never talk specifics. Not in a speech. But the fact that you have no idea what to say is, believe it or not, the least of our worries.
Dwight: It is?
Michael: It's your delivery...
Dwight: What is?
Michael: Our biggest worry.
Dwight: I don't follow.
Michael: My God, Dwight. The best way to learn is by watching. That's why porn is a multi-trillion-dollar industry. Listen. Okay. Sit down, let me wow you. [clears throat] [shouting]
Dwight: Oh, God!
Michael: See, I have your attention now, don't I? You're scared, but now you're ready to learn.
Dwight: Well, that didn't go well.
Michael: No, it did not. And that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor. We'll find you a joke that not even you can ruin.
Michael: All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.
Dwight: [whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...
Meredith: Please don't tell a sailor joke.
Dwight: Oh, why not?
Phyllis: Her nephew's in Iraq.
Michael: Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.
Pam: Yes, but they are both in danger.
Michael: Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.
Michael: Who's gonna start. How about Phyllis? You kick us off and then we'll move around. Go ahead.
Phyllis: What are we supposed to talk about?
Michael: Anything your heart desires.
Phyllis: I would like to toast to the good fortune I've been having lately...
Michael: [shouting] Louder!
Phyllis: I, uh, I met a man and I'm totally in love, and that's a chapter of my life that I thought had closed. Uh, I was terribly depressed for the longest time and I have to admit I had some very dark thoughts...
Michael: Good. Good, good, good. That's good. Now see, that's not so hard, right? All right. Who's next? Who are we going to... Ryan. Ryan's next.
Ryan: Why am I next? I thought we'd go in order?
Michael: Don't be shy, shy boy. Don't be shy. Get up there.
Ryan: Well... A lot of you know that I'm in business school. And while I'm learning a lot here, a lot, hopefully soon I'll land a challenging full-time or part-time position somewhere else.
Dwight: All right.
Stanley: Way to go, Ryan!
Michael: Stop! Stop! Stop! That's, you know what? The toast is really not supposed to be about anything. It's certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else, so...
Michael: Ryan is a temp, and that means that he could go at any time. Am I worried about that? Try scared to death.
Ryan: I got the stamps.
Pam: The ones that say 'love' on them?
Ryan: The ones that say '39 cents.'
Pam: Oh. Doesn't matter.
Ryan: I didn't think it did.
Pam: As soon as they leave, well get Kelly and start.
Ryan: Kelly's helping?
Pam: Is that okay?
Ryan: Yeah, sure.
Michael: Ghosts. Lots of ghosts in this old Radisson. There it is, Rosebud Room. Memories. Wow, this turnout is pathetic. I packed the house, you know.
Dwight: Oh, no, I don't think this is it.
Michael: Numismatic. Numismatic Collectors. Nope, wrong room.
Michael: Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.
Dwight: Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
Michael: You're weird.
Dwight: No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
Michael: Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
Michael: Ah, look at me. I'm huge in Wilkes-Barre. Performing nightly, Michael Scott. Not comedy fans here, which is fine because not having a sense of humor is just as fine as having one. Questions? Comment? Can't see you, but I know that you're not breathing. I know you're breathing. Is this on? Hello? 'Well, isn't that... Well, isn't that special?' 'Jell-O pudding.' Bill Cosby. I think Bill Cosby said it best when he talked about his brother and all of the fun he... All the great things they did together as kids. And there was the one time when he put the snowball in the freezer, and it... And he waited for five months and then he took the snowball out and he threw it... He would have thrown it at the kid but then his mother had thrown out the snowball so he couldn't throw it. So... Bill Cosby is smoking! And now some race car. [imitating race car engine] That brings me to my... Brings me to a point that you should always have a list of your clients. It's important to because a client list is next to godliness... List. [baby crying] Could you shut him up, please? I mean, who brings a baby to a sales conference? Really rude.
Pam: I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.
Jim: Bribery. Nice.
Pam: Oh, I have more. [Holds up bags of candy]
Michael: Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
Pam: Oh, Michael. You can't be nasty today. [whispering] 'Cause of the... [points to 'Welcome Daughters!' sign]
Michael: ... Oh, God is that today?
Pam: I reminded you last night.
Michael: Listen, I like kids. But this is not a kid's environment. This is like HBO, no limits. Who knows what I'm going to say? Crazy stuff. And it is R rated, it is not rated G. I am like Eddie Murphy in 'Raw,' and they are trying to make me into Eddie Murphy in 'Daddy Daycare.' both great movies, but, still.
Michael: Well, I'll be in my office.
Pam: Don't you think you should say something?
Michael: They're cool.
Pam: Michael, I think that as the boss you should really---
Michael: Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
Jim and Dwight: [in unison] That's Batman.
Michael: Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
Jim: The ocean.
Michael: [under his breath] I work with a bunch of nerds.
Dwight: [looks at Sasha] Mmm... hello tiny one.
Toby: [to Sasha] Come on.
Dwight: You are the future!
Kevin: This... is my file cabinet. Uhm... oh. This... is the partition... between my desk... and Angela's.
Kevin: Abby's my fiancee Stacy's daughter, I think she'll have a good time. I just hope she doesn't look on my computer. ...Actually, I'd better go check.
Stanley: Michael, you remember my daughter, Melissa.
Michael: Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
Melissa: I'm in eighth grade.
Michael: Oh.
Stanley: She's in middle school.
Michael: Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
Michael: It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.
Michael: [while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?
Meredith: Um, fif--well, fifty... I... over ordered because they had a back order.
Michael: Okay.
Meredith: I got permission to bring Jake into work, which is great because he got suspended this week and now I don't have to pay for a sitter.
Angela: Can you put that down there?
Kelly: Yep. [spreads tablecloth]
Toby: [to Sasha] Okay, tell them what you wanted to say.
Sasha: Do you need any help?
Angela: No. Thanks. We'd... have to explain everything, it's probably just easier if we do it ourselves.
Toby: Alright, I wasn't expecting that. Let's uh... let's go draw.
Kelly: Oh my God, she is so cute, I want to die. Don't you just love kids, Angela?
Angela: I guess I wouldn't mind a pair of small, well-behaved boys.
Kelly: God I cannot wait to get pregnant and have babies!
Ryan: Kelly and I both agreed that we would just have fun, and, I'm learning that fun for Kelly is... getting married and having babies. Immediately. With me.
Michael: [on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different. [Sasha walks out] Yeah, we can stick with last year's, you're just going to have to supplement it, somehow.
Pam: Hey, Abby! Do you want to help me shred some old documents? It's actually pretty cool.
Abby: No thanks.
Pam: I only have one goal today. To make one kid like me. Just one.
Jim: What are you reading?
Abby: From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.
Jim: Aww, best book?
Abby: Yeah, but I've read it before.
Jim: Pfft. So have I. Hey, question. If you had to spend a night in the Met or the Aquarium, which would it be?
Abby: Definitely the Aquarium.
Jim: Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Abby: Sure.
Jim: Really?
Abby: Mmhmm!
Jim: Yesss. And you're Abby, right?
Abby: Yeah.
Jim: I'm Jim. [Jim hi-fives Abby] Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Abby: Alright.
Jim: Let's start with... your mom.
Michael: [on phone] Yes. Well... we can... [Sasha walks in, begins playing with Michael's toy train] uhm... hey, uh, you know what? Can I call you back? I'll call you right back. Yes, I promise. ...Hello, can I help you? ... You can pick that up, if you want. That's--- that's alright. [Sasha moves the train to Michael's desk] Want to bring it over... here, make some room. My name's Michael. What's your name?
Sasha: Sasha.
Michael: Nice to meet you.
Sasha: Ooh! [picks up train whistle]
Michael: Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?
Sasha: Sure. [Sasha blows into whistle continously]
Michael: All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]
Jim: [shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.
Dwight: There is no way that hurt.
Jim: Really? 'Cause she's pretty strong, Dwight.
Dwight: Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day. [Abby shakes his hand] I don't feel anything. Nothing. [to Jim] You're so weak. [Jake walks over and messes with Dwight's bobbleheads] Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay?
Jake: Do you have any computer games?
Dwight: No, I don't have computer games on my work computer. That would be innappropriate.
Jake: Yeah, Meredith doesn't have any either. It's so lame here.
Dwight: You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
Jake: Whatever, okay?
Dwight: You can refer to me as Mister Schrute.
Jake: That's your name? Mister Poop?
Dwight: Schrute. Mister Schrute.
Jake: Sure, Mister Poop. [Jake walks away]
Dwight: [quietly] ... Schrute. [Jim and Abby snicker, Angela glares at Dwight]
Sasha: [to Phyllis] Are you Mother Goose?
Melissa: I drink like, a hundred Ice Macchiatos a day, and practically nothing else.
Ryan: Wow.
Melissa: There's a really cool coffee place, Jitters, at the Steamtown Mall. Ever been there?
Ryan: No.
Melissa: You've never been to Jitters? Ryan, you are
Ryan: Uhm...
Melissa: Come on! [Kelly glares through the door] You have an email address?
Kelly: ...that I thought you should know ...
Stanley: Mmhmm. What?
Kelly: I think something a little fishy is going on. [points to Ryan and Melissa]
Stanley: A little fishy?
Kelly: Yeah. I mean, I've been noticing them all day, I was thinking that maybe ... [Stanley gets up]
Stanley: That little girl is a child! I don't want to see you sniffing around her anymore this afternoon, do you understand?!
Ryan: Yes, I--
Stanley: Boy have you lost your mind? 'Cause I'll help you find it! Whatcha lookin' for, ain't nobody gonna help you out there! Jesus could come through that door and he's not gonna help you if you don't stop sniffing after my child!
Ryan: Okay.
Ryan: Stanley yelled at me today. That was one of the most frightening experiences of my life.
Dwight: [plays the recorder] That was Greensleeves. A traditional English Ballad about the beheaded Anne Boleyn. And now, a very special treat... a book my Grandmutter used to read me when I was a kid.  This is a very special story, it's called Struwwelpeter, by Heinrich Hoffman from 1864. [reading from book] The great tall tailor always comes to little girls that suck their thumbs--- are you listening, Sasha? Right? And 'ere they dream when he's about, he takes his great sharp scissors out, and then cuts their thumbs clean off!
Michael: Dwight! Dwight!
Dwight: There's a photo...
Michael: What the hell are you reading to them?
Dwight: These are cautionary tales for kids, my Grandmata used to read these---
Michael: Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
Sasha: What's a Nazi?
Michael: What's a Nazi?
Dwight: [standing up] Nazi was a fascist movement...
Michael: Don't!
Dwight: ...from the 1930's...
Michael: Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
Dwight: I was gonna teach the children how to make corn-husk dolls.
Michael: [sighing] Why don't you just leave? Okay?
Dwight: ...Okay.
Jake: Bye, Mister Poop.
Michael: Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
The Kids: [raising hands] I do, I do!
Michael: Children cannot lie. They are innocent, and they speak the truth, and out of the mouths of babes, Michael Scott is freaking cool. [cracks up]
Angela: You know, I never misbehaved in front of my father because he was a very strict disciplinarian. I can only hope my mate has some of those same qualities [makes eye contact with Dwight].
Michael: This is where the magic happens! Right over here, let me show you this. See all these? [pets shelf of paper] You know what that is? That's paper. This is where paper comes from. Any questions?
Melissa: So... you cut the paper and dye it and stuff.
Michael: No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
Abby: That's not fair. [the rest of the kids agree]
Michael: Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
Jake: You're just a middleman.
Michael: I'm not just a middle... man...
Melissa: Wait, why doesn't the saw mill just sell paper directly to people?
Michael: You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
Dwight: We have better service than they do!
Michael: ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
Creed: That is correct.
Michael: Say hi to the kids.
Creed: Hi kids.
Michael: Yaaaaay.
Creed: Have you ever seen a foot with four toes? [begins untying shoe]
Kids: Ewwww!
Michael: What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
Creed: Th-the hair covers it, mostly.
Michael: No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
Michael: You know, there's something interesting about me you might want to know. I ... used to be ... the star of a kids show.
Kids: No way.
Michael: It's true. I did.
Melissa: You serious?
Jake: Really?
Michael: I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
Abby: That doesn't sound like a show.
Melissa: What?!
Michael: It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this. [gets up and runs out] Ryan, can you come here a second? [clears throat] I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
Ryan: Right. Okay.
Michael: I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
Ryan: Um, I'm already getting the pizzas from Bernetti's, so...
Melissa: You know, I can go with him.
Michael: Oka--
Ryan: No! I will... go.
Michael: Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
Michael: [to Abby] Alright, nowwww... what kind... of pizza do you like?
Michael: I don't get why parents are always complaining about how tough it is to raise kids. You joke around with them, you give them pizza, you give them candy, you let them live their lives... They're adults, for God's sake.
Michael: I am going to give you a little blast from the past of Michael Gary Scott when he was a child star, and a show that you might remember called 'Fundle Bundle.' Okay? Without further ado, Ryan?
Miss Trudy: [from TV] ...Bundle, are you ready to come on in? [TV children cheer] Let's have some fun!
Michael: That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
Dwight: Is that a real fun shooting windmill?
Michael: Stop! Stop! Stop! [Ryan resumes the tape] Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
Jim: That's pretty funny.
Michael: Yeah.
Edward R. Meow: ...Recess! Hey, what's your name?
Chet: My name's Chet.
Edward R. Meow: Well hi Chet.
Oscar: Is that Chet Montgomery?
Michael: Uhh, I don't know.
Pam: That is!
Darryl: Checkin' in with Chet. Doppler's up.
Edward R. Meow: What do you want to be when you grow up?
Chet: I want to be on TV!
Dwight: [employees chuckle] And he
Michael: Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
Edward R. Meow: Okay, next? So, whats your name?
Michael: Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
Edward R. Meow: Well what's your favorite subject at school?
Young Michael: Recess.
Edward R. Meow: Ree-cesss. So tell me, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Young Michael: I want to be married and have a hundred kids so I can have a hundred friends, and no one can say no to being my friend.
Edward R. Meow: [jaw drops, awkward pause] Uh, ah... oh, okay! Well uh, nice talking with you, Michael. Uh, back to you Miss Trudy!
Miss Trudy: Hi everyone, it's one of my favorite times of the day.
Michael: Coulda sworn there was...
Melissa: Did you get married?
Michael: ...uh, no.
Abby: Why not?
Michael: Uh, just never happened.
Sasha: So, do you have any kids?
Michael: Uh, nope.
Jake: Do you have a girlfriend?
Michael: I do okay.
Melissa: Was Chet Montgomery cool back then?
Michael: Yes.
Jake: Even I have a girlfriend.
Michael: Okay! Alright, okay.
Sasha: So you didn't get to be what you wanted to be.
Michael: ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
Pam: He's not coming out. He won't pick up the phone.
Jim: Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Roy: [wrestling with Jake] Pam! Pam! I love this guy! [laughs] Come on!
Pam: So, Melissa... I met your mom a couple times. She's
Melissa: Who?  Terry?
Pam: Mmhmm.
Melissa: That woman is not my mother. That is my step-mother.
Jake: Mister Poop, I have to tell you something.
Dwight: Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name.
Jake: You're ugly.
Dwight: Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
Jake: Meredith!
Michael: [Toby knocks on door] Yeah?
Toby: I think these belong to you. [puts toys down on desk]
Michael: Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
Toby: Believe me, she has enough toys... she doesn't need your watch.
Michael: Thank you.
Toby: Is everything okay?
Michael: You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
Toby: Uh... it's true...
Michael: Well, sure, playing the field is great, don't get me wrong, but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost.
Toby: Mmhmm.
Michael: Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
Toby: Well, you need a wife first, or at least a girlfriend.
Michael: What about...
Toby: Not Jan.
Michael: ...Jan. Kay.
Toby: If you really want to have kids, I--- I guess you could somehow... foster parent, or something.
Michael: ...Or biologically.
Toby: Somehow.
Michael: Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
Toby: Yes.
Michael: Oh... kay.
Jake: Is it okay if I take one?
Pam: Sure.
Jake: Thank you.
Pam: You're welcome.
Jake: Is your job hard?
Pam: It's not too bad. I get to shred things sometimes, do you want to see?
Jake: Yeah!
Pam: Really?
Jake: Yeah.
Pam: Okay. Um... here it is. Don't put your fingers in there. [shreds paper] Cool huh?
Jake: That's so cool, yeah!
Pam: Yeah, I get to do this like, every week.
Jake: That's so awesome!
Pam: I know.
Michael: Yes, it is true. I, Michael Scott, am signing up with an online dating service. Thousands of people have done it, and I am going to do it. I need a username. And... I have a great one [types]. Little kid lover. That way, people will know exactly where my priorities are at.
Kevin: Go ahead.
Abby: Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
Jim: Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time? [Abby nods]
Kevin: What're you doing? You never have plans.
Jim: Thanks, Kev. Uhm... I'm actually going on a date.
Kevin: Niiice.
Michael: Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
Michael: [singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...
Jim: Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?
Pam: I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves]
Michael and Dwight: [singing] ...did slowly go by... and feed... them on your dreams...
Pam: My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]
Michael and Dwight: [singing] ...The one they picked... the one you'll know by... don't you ever ask them why... if I told you would cry... you never look at them and sigh... and know they love you...
Dwight: And they do, your parents, love you very much.
Michael: One more time. [singing] You...
Dwight: The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.
Angela: Okay. I think five plain and one veggie should be fine.
Phyllis: How about pepperoni?
Angela: No.
Ryan: I like extra cheese.
Angela: Absolutely not.
Pam: I like extra cheese, too.
Angela: Fine. The first lesson we'll teach children will be about obesity.
Ryan: Thank you.
Jim: I'm pretty excited about today. I baby-sit Toby's daughter Sasha sometimes. So, she's the coolest kid. She has seen me play with dolls, though, so I don't know how cool she thinks I am.
Stanley: Put that away and learn.
Melissa: Learn what?
Stanley: Learn why Daddy's so cranky when he comes home from work.
Stanley: I brought my daughter Melissa in. That girl is very spoiled. That child has no idea what I have to deal with so she can have her little cell phone and spend all my money at that Steamtown Mall.
Abby: I'm gonna go read my book now.
Kevin: [whispering] Angela. Is it okay if I'm the head accountant today?
Angela: I'm the head accountant.
Kevin: Yeah, but can I say that I'm it, just for today?
Angela: I can't set that kind of precedent. She's a bright girl. She'd see right through that.
Darryl: You must be pretty strong, huh?
Jake: Yeah.
Roy: You think you can beat up Darryl?
Jake: Yeah. I don't know, maybe.
Roy: I think you might be able to.
Darryl: You think you could beat me up?
Jake: Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Darryl: Then you gotta have muscles, man. You got some muscles? Let's see.
Jake: I got some muscles. You wanna see the muscles? Bam! Look at that.
Michael: Hey, don't touch him, please!
Darryl: Man, you have got to be kidding me.
Michael: Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Jake: Can I have a quarter? I promise I'll pay you back.
Michael: Sure.
Jake: Can I have a dollar? Then I can buy chips and a drink.
Michael: Okay. There you go.
Jake: Will you marry my mom?
Oscar: Melissa. Hey. I was working. I was in the middle of something.
Melissa: Just give me two seconds, I'll be done.
Oscar: I was in the middle of something.
Melissa: Dude, seriously, just give me two seconds, I'll be done.
Oscar: Stanley.
Abby: ...get you, I'm gonna get you! Come back here for more! [squealing]
Creed: Kids, kids, kids, slow down.
Abby: Oh, I'm gonna get you!
Dwight: What the... [pulls a pencil eraser out of his mug, after a drink]
Abby: Did you draw that?
Pam: Yeah. Do you like to draw, Abby?
Abby: Yeah, I wanna be an artist when I grow up.
Pam: Me, too.
Abby: You are grown up.
Kelly: So, how's your day been?
Pam: Okay. It's been a little more tiring than I thought.
Kelly: Yeah, it doesn't help that Stanley's daughter's such a slut.
Pam: Hmm.
Jim: Hey, Abby. I wanted to give you this for all your hard work today. Look. Michael signed it and everything. Official.
Abby: Thank you so much.
Jim: Absolutely.
Dwight: Oh, I hate to break it to you, Abby. The certificate's a fake. Okay? It's not real. Where's the certification number, Halpert?
Jim: Actually, I have the certification number right here.
Dwight: Oh, really? Uh-huh.
Jim: Yup.
Dwight: Oh. Okay. Fine. Well done.
Jim: All right.
Jim: A7557962.' Totally nonsense numbers, but you do what you have to do.
Michael: So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.
Oscar: Who is this guy again?
Michael: Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
Ryan: Who uses calling cards anymore?
Michael: You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
Oscar: This sounds like a get rich quick scheme.
Michael: Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
Toby: Didn't you lose a lot of money on that other investment, the one from the email?
Michael: You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.
Jim: No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?
Michael: Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's... [Jim draws a triangle around Michael's diagram] ... I have to go make a call.
Pam: Happy birthday Michael.
Michael: Oh ho ho! What?
Pam: I said happy birthday.
Michael: Thank you! That's really nice.
Michael: Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a
Michael: What's up?
Jim: Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
Michael: Ah, thank you sir.
Meredith: Did you hear anything yet?
Kevin: No. I'm still waiting.
Michael: [Dwight knocks on door] Yeah.
Dwight: Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
Michael: Ohh, god.
Dwight: Birthday hug!
Michael: No no no, no, new suit, please.
Dwight: That suit is amazing.
Michael: Thank you very much. It is from Italy. [checks jacket] Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
Dwight: Mmm. Maybe I should get one.
Michael: Good luck. One of a kind.
Dwight: Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?
Michael: Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Dwight: Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Michael: Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Dwight: Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof']
Michael: Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in]
Phyllis: When should we bring out the cake, one or one thirty?
Pam: One's good.
Angela: One thirty. [Pam yawns] I'm sorry, are we boring you?
Dwight: Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
Phyllis: Where do we get those?
Dwight: Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam]
Pam: Michael wants a strippergram?
Dwight: Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.
Angela: No. This is a closed door meeting.
Michael: [answering phone] Yeah?
Pam: Michael, I have Jan on the line.
Michael: Oh, great, put her through.
Jan: Hello, Michael.
Michael: Hey, you.
Jan: I'm... returning your call, you said it was urgent.
Michael: It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
Jan: Well, today's not my birthday, so...
Michael: Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Jan: ...Happy birthday, Michael.
Michael: Thanks. [grins]
Jan: Am I on camera?
Michael: Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart. [Jan hangs up]
Michael: [to Ryan, sitting across from Michael] ...You can take a five, if you want.
Michael: Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!
Stanley: Mmhmm, happy birthday.
Michael: Thanks.
Jim: Man, I'm so sorry. When do you find out?
Kevin: They said this afternoon. They're waiting on a second opinion.
Jim: Oh, okay.
Kelly: Second opinion on what?
Kevin: Um, I might have skin cancer.
Kelly: Oh, no! I was watching Grey's Anatomy, and there was a lifeguard on it, and
Jim: Kelly, you know what...
Kelly: I never really thought about death until Princess Diana died. That was the saddest funeral ever. That and my sister's.
Toby: Who brought in donuts?
Michael: Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Toby: Happy birthday!
Michael: You didn't know it was my birthday.
Toby: I... guess I forgot.
Michael: Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut [closes box].
Toby: Are you serious?
Michael: Mmm.
Oscar: Skin cancer is treatable.
Kevin: Right.
Oscar: It's going to be okay.
Angela: You don't know it's going to be okay. Don't give him false hope. ...It's probably nothing, though.
Delivery Woman: Hi, delivery for Michael Scott.
Michael: Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink! [puts single into delivery woman's pocket, giggles] Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
Delivery Woman: Uh... s-sure.
Michael: [laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous.
Pam: I can sign for it.
Delivery Woman: Oh. Thanks.
Michael: When I was seven, my mother hired a pony and a cart to come to my house for all the kids... and... I got a really bad rash from the pony, and all the kids got to ride the pony and I had to go inside, and my mother was rubbing cream on me... for probably three hours, and I never came outside. And by the time I got out the pony was already in the truck. And around the corner. So that was my worst birthday.
Michael: [eating donuts while Dwight plays the recorder] Stop it. Stop! What is that?
Dwight: It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.
Michael: Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
Dwight: I probably care more than she does.
Michael: You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].
Pam: When does he hear?
Jim: Sometime today.
Pam: Ohh... poor Kevin.
Pam: If I knew I had a week to live, I would... probably go to Europe. And South America. And the Grand Canyon. And... I would want to see the Pacific Ocean. ...It would be a pretty busy week.
Dwight: Uh, that's a list price of four dollars and fifty cents.  Unfortunately, this item is on [watch beeps] back... order... [hangs up] Michael! Michael! Michael Michael Michael! Come here, come here, come here!  Come here!
Michael: What?
Dwight: Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
Michael: [grinning] Ohhh, God.
Dwight: There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Michael: Ohhh, no.
Dwight: So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!
Oscar: ...I'll do it.
Michael: Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
Dwight: Creed! Come on. Stanley!
Pam: ...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?
Jim: Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
Dwight: On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Happy birth moment, Michael.
Michael: Thank you.
Dwight: One. Two. Three! [Michael is raised until his head hits the ceiling]
Michael: Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
Dwight: Oscar...
Oscar: It wasn't me.
Dwight: Okay, that is
Delivery Boy: Uh, we don't make an eight foot sub. This is eight one foot subs.
Dwight: F. Alright, what's the damage?
Delivery Boy: Uh, thirty-nine sixty.
Dwight: [pulls out wallet] Thirty nine... sixty.
Dwight: Why tip someone for a job I'm capable of doing myself? I can deliver food. I can drive a taxi. I can, and do, cut my own hair. I did, however, tip my urologist, because... I am unable to pulverize my own kidney stones.
Dwight: Here they come.
Michael: Get in here... everybody.
Dwight: Come and get it!
Michael: Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
Oscar: What is this?
Dwight: Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
Michael: The best.
Stanley: These are all the same?
Michael: Yes.
Angela: Bologna? I don't eat bologna.
Michael: Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
Angela: No.
Michael: Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
Angela: No.
Michael: Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.
Michael: When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So...
Jim: So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.
Pam: Sixty-nine cup of noodles.
Jim: Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.
Pam: And his favorite lunch.
Dwight: Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].
Ryan: [making peanut butter and jelly sandwich] Someone ate three feet of that thing?
Dwight: Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.
Angela: [grabs cake] Oh. Thank you.
Dwight: Oh. I got it.
Angela: What are--- it's... the party planning committee.
Dwight: [whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
Angela: Fine.
Dwight: What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
Angela: Yes... [whispering] but don't expect any cookie.
Dwight: [whispering] But what if i'm hungry?
Angela: [whispering]
Jim: [puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?
Pam: You use fabric softener?
Jim: Yeah, you don't?
Pam: No, I do.
Jim: ...Okay.
Office Staff: [singing] Happy birthday dear Michael, [Michael joins in, Kevin's phone rings] Happy birthday... [everyone but Dwight stops] ...tooo youuuu.
Kevin: Hello? Hey.
Michael: Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Kevin: No, um, no not yet. I will. Bye. [hangs up] It was just Stacy.
Michael: Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Dwight: Here we go. Make a wish.
Michael: Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles]
Dwight: Yaoo yay! [claps]
Michael: ... I asked for trick candles.
Dwight: Pam was supposed to get 'em.
Michael: Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
Angela: No one cares about your birthday. Kevin's waiting to hear if he has skin cancer.
Michael: ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].
Pam: [checking watch] We should probably head back.
Jim: Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
Pam: You dare me? How old are you?
Jim: Just... quit stalling.
Pam: [over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.
Jim: Such a dork.
Pam: [loudspeaker] Jim Halpert? Price check on fabric softener, the kind that gives you...
Store Employee: Ma'am? Please don't touch that. That is not a toy.
Pam: Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Jim: How old are you?
Pam: I hate you.
Toby: [to Kevin] Honestly, is there any way you can get on your fiancee's plan? Our health plan is s... just... it's terrible.
Michael: There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Kevin: Still scary.
Michael: Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
Kevin: Well the doctor said a combination of interferon and dicarbazine.
Michael: And laughter... also.
Toby: I don't really think people are in the laughing mood.
Michael: Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
Toby: I work here.
Michael: [mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
Kevin: If I go home now, I'll just drive myself crazy.
Michael: Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
Dwight: Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.
Jim: Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
Dwight: Please, don't.
Jim: You... owe me.
Michael: Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
Stanley: Is this trip related in any way to your... birthday?
Michael: How dare you sir. You are gross.
Michael: [sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.
Dwight: I'll get someone to take it down.
Michael: No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
Kelly: Don't be scared! You're good! You're good!
Ryan: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
Jim: Think you can let go?
Pam: No. [laughs]
Jim: Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by]
Dwight: YEAH!
Pam: Who is that?
Jim: Is that Michael?
Michael: Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.
Pam: I got it.
Michael: Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Jim: ...It's something to think about.
Kevin: I can't relax about it, you know?
Michael: Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Kevin: No, not yet.
Michael: Okay. Well. Live strong.
Kevin: Okay, Michael.
Michael: Alright.
Carol: Michael?
Michael: Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
Carol: Uhh, no, I... don't just sell real estate. Uh, my daughter has a skating lesson.
Michael: Oh, these... all your kids?
Carol: No just the front two.
Michael: Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
Carol: Sure.
Michael: Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Michael: Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.
Kevin: Hello? Yeah okay. Alright. Okay, I will, thanks. [hangs up] It was negative.
Michael: Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].
Michael: Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.
Kevin: This is awesome. Thanks, you guys.
Michael: Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Dwight: Turn it around. Turn it around.
Michael: Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Dwight: Number one!!
Michael: Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
Pam: Michael?
Michael: Yeah.
Pam: This is from all of us.
Michael: Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
Pam: Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.
Jim: Michael's birthday. It's pretty fun to watch, actually. He gets very excited, and then he eats a lot of cake. And then he runs around the office. Then he has a sugar crash in the afternoon. And then he falls asleep. And that's when we get our work done.
Dwight: Let's get the party started.
Michael: That's not how I taught you, right? [singing] My hump, my hump, my lovely lady lump Check it out [Dwight imitating drumbeat]
Dwight: Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.
Michael: Okay, here's the thing about bosses and employees. A good boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate me.' A great boss will say, 'Hey, it's my birthday. Celebrate yourselves, because you are the ones who made me great, and I will acknowledge your contributions with donuts.'
Michael: Good. You know, Ryan, you didn't have to get me a present.
Ryan: I won't.
Michael: Good. Great.
Ryan: Okay, good. I think I'm gonna go.
Michael: No, I think you're gonna stay.
Michael: On my 20th birthday, my supposed best friend, Sam Ambrose, ditched me for his twin sister's Sweet Sixteen party. And that was my worst birthday. Until today.
Kevin: Can you please stop staring at me? [Dwight continues to stare and then walks away]
Dwight: To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.
Michael: [knock on door] Mmm-hmm.
Ryan: Hey. I got the information.
Michael: Oh, good. Okay. Don't tell me, tell them.
Ryan: [turns to camera] 'The survival rate for localized melanoma is 98%.'
Michael: Oh, my God. That's a piece of cake. That's a piece of cake. Oh, 2%. Jeez, that's good.
Ryan: [looking at camera] 'There was 7,800 deaths from melanoma in 2005.'
Michael: Out of, like, 18 billion Americans, so, no worry.
Ryan: For localized melanoma, the five-year survival rate is 98%. The survival rates for regional and...'
Michael: Those were probably misdiagnosed. I mean, anybody with a zit goes in and says, 'I have cancer.'
Ryan: The skin is the largest organ of the body.'
Michael: Untrue. The heart is bigger than the skin. If you stretched the heart out, it would cover more than the entire body.
Angela: I'm not afraid of dying. I know where I'm going. But if I were Kevin, I might be terrified. Gluttony.
Michael: Oh hey, Kevin, nice of you to join us, where were you?
Kevin: My tire blew out on the way here, Michael.
Michael: Huh?
Kevin: I almost died. I... I went into this skid---
Michael: Pop quiz.
Kevin: ...What?
Michael: Why is today a special day?
Kevin: I almost died.
Michael: Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
Ryan: You will be a guest speaker... in my Emerging Enterprises class.
Michael: In business school, Kevin. Business school.
Kevin: Wow.
Ryan: If you bring your boss to class, it automatically bumps you up a full letter grade. So... I'd be stupid
Michael: A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.
Michael: Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?
Dwight: Don't be an idiot.' Changed my life.
Dwight: Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing.
Michael: Will they throw their hats, you think?
Ryan: What?
Michael: A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Ryan: Y-You understand nobody's graduating.
Michael: Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line.
Ryan: ...It doesn't apply.
Michael: I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!
Ryan: Quit it!
Michael: We have fun.
Roy: I can't for your art show tonight.
Pam: Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.
Roy: I-I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Pam: Thanks.
Pam: I'm really happy to be back with Roy. I think it shows maturity. Maturity and dignity. ... Is that braggy? I don't mean it to be braggy.
Roy: Love ya.
Pam: You too.
Jim: Pam's with Roy. I'm with Karen. And, uh, Brangelina is with Frangelina. Movin' on.
Kelly: I can't believe you're back together with Roy!
Pam: Oh, yeah! We have such a solid foundation, you know.
Kelly: Oh my God. You're so in love now.
Pam: Yeah. Oh, you should come to my art show, by the way.
Kelly: Oh, art show!
Pam: I mean, it's not a big deal, but I think a lot of people from the office will be there.
Kelly: ...Oh... yeah. Definitely... I'll be there. For sure.
Michael: Campus. Brings back so many memories. ... That I would have made. Hey. Frisbee. Check that out. Aww! What do you say we get our Fris on before class? [runs over, throws frisbee] Whoo!
College Student: ....Dude.
Dwight: ...Oh my God. Animal stool. [jumps on desk]
Pam: Dwight, what are you doing?
Dwight: Solving a mystery, if that's quite alright with you. [opens ceiling tile] Come to Papa. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent. Fortunately I have found it befo--BAT! BAAAT! BAT!
Karen: Oh my God!
Dwight: BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Stanley: Goooood bye.
Angela: [on ground] ... Please don't let that stupid thing near me...
Michael: Okay, this is it. Ryan is doing my intro right now.
Ryan: ...Dunder-Mifflin can't compete with the modern chains, and management is unwilling, or unable, to adapt. Their customers are dying off...
Michael: I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
Dwight: We have... a bat... in the office.
Toby: The simple solution would be to open a window... if we had... windows that could open.
Angela: Poop is raining from the ceilings. Poop!
Jim: Okay. Thanks. [hangs up phone] Animal control will be here at six.
Dwight: At Six?! No, that is unacceptable. Okay, Jim, you are the number two in this office. You need to step up and show some leadership.
Jim: I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...
Dwight: What? What's so wierd?
Jim: The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful... [shrugs] Oh well.
Ryan: And now, without further ado, I present the regional manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton, Michael Scott.
Michael: Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
Dwight: [sighs] This is your job, Halpert.
Jim: Ow!
Karen: Oh, what happened?
Jim: That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot.
Karen: But Jim, this garlic bread is cold.
Jim: What? ... No. It burned me. I... bizarre.
Dwight: No... no. One crisis at a time.
Dwight: If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.
Michael: So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar]. [pulls out a Snickers] Satisfied?
Toby: Oh, this looks great. I'd, I'd love to be there, but my daughter's play is tonight. ... Damnit! You know, one of the other parents will probably videotape it.
Pam: Oh! No, you should go.
Toby: Well, it's important to support local art, you know. And what they do is not art.
Michael: Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.
Ryan: Michael.
Michael: ...And products!
Ryan: What we normally do here is more of a question and answer thing.
Michael: Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
Business Student #1: Sir, as a company that primary distributes paper, how have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Michael: We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]
Karen: Hey Jim, here's the aspirin you wanted.
Jim: Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Karen: What glare?
Jim: The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.
Dwight: I don't have a lot of experience with vampires, but I have hunted werewolves. I shot one once. But by the time I got to it, it had turned back into my neighbor's dog.
Dwight: Extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions. We form an allegiance--
Creed: Sure.
Dwight: --to use sudden violence.
Creed: Okay.
Dwight: Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?
Creed: What size?
Business Student #2: What do you say to a customer who wants to leave you for the convenience and savings of a nationwide chain?
Michael: ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
Business Student #2: Has anyone ever come back?
Michael: ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
Business Student #3: How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
Michael: Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
Business Student #3: ...What?
Michael: Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
Business Student #1: By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years.
Michael: ...Wait, Ryan said that?
Kelly: What are you doing? You'd better not hurt that little bat.
Creed: Animals can't feel pain.
Kelly: Don't hurt that bat, Creed! It's a living thing with feelings and a family!
Dwight: Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!
Kelly: AHH! KILL IT! KILL IT! KILL IIIT!
Kevin: [locks bat in break room] I... am a hero!
Michael: Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.
Business Student #2: But how can you compete against a company with the resources of a nationwide chain?
Michael: David will always beat Goliath.
Business Student #1: But there's five Goliaths, there's... Staples, Officemax...
Michael: Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
Business Student #1: But in the big picture...
Michael: Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!
Ryan: ...It wasn't personal.
Michael: Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
Ryan: Pack my--?
Michael: You heard me, pack your things.
Meredith: I really want to come out!
Creed: Good night, Mary Beth!
Jim: So... you're cool to just wait here for animal control?
Dwight: Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.
Jim: Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight.
Dwight: Goodbye Jim. And good luck.
Dwight: Jim is on a path now. An eternal journey, and I wish him well. But I have a destiny in this realm. Specifically, in the kitchen.
Pam: ...And it's all from the same series.
Woman: Oh.
Pam: Called 'Impressions.'
Woman: Oh.
Pam: Not that I call myself an impressionist, per se.
Woman: Maybe one day.
Pam: I hope so.
Woman: Mmm.
Pam: I still need... you know, my breakthrough, or whatever. [Woman leaves, Roy enters] Hey, babe, how are you?
Roy: Good. Alright I brought my brother, huh?
Pam: Hey, Kenny.
Kenny: Hey Pam.
Roy: How 'bout this, huh? I show up with my brother, and, no one from work is here? That's... pretty cool, huh?
Dwight: Magic time. Gyeeeaahhh! [puts bag over Meredith's head]
Meredith: Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
Dwight: Hold still, woman!
Meredith: Get off me! Get it off! Ahhhh!
Dwight: ...[captures bat in bag] ... You're welcome.
Roy: It's cool if I go, right? I mean, I looked at all of them.
Pam: Yeah, I'll just, I'll drive myself home.
Roy: To my place?
Pam: Maybe, I'm a little tired.
Roy: Your art.. was the prettiest art of... all art.
Pam: Thank you.
Ryan: Look, I'm sorry, okay? I was just trying to do my presentation, and... of course, I was wrong to suggest that Dunder-Mifflin might ever go out of business. But you don't have to fire me.
Michael: Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
Ryan: To the annex? Where... Kelly is?
Michael: A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Oscar: You're the one who said we needed more culture.
Gil: This is culture to you?
Oscar: It's her first try.
Gil: Yeah, on Van Gogh's first try, he drew the hands of the peasants.
Oscar: Meaning what?
Gil: Meaning, real art takes courage, okay? And honesty.
Oscar: Well, those aren't Pam's strong points.
Gil: Yeah, exactly. That's why this is... motel art.
Artist: Thanks for coming.
Michael: Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
Pam: Oh, Michael.
Michael: Wow! You did these... freehand?
Pam: Yep.
Michael: My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it. [sighs] ... How much?
Pam: What do you mean?
Michael: I don't see a... price.
Pam: Um... you wanna buy it?
Michael: Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
Pam: Uh-huh.
Michael: That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Pam: [hugs Michael] ... Thank you.
Michael: What?
Pam: Do you have something in your pocket?
Michael: ...Chunky. Do you want half?
Pam: No thank you.
Michael: Okay.
Michael: It is... a message. It is an inspiration, it is... a source of beauty. And without paper, it could not have happened. Unless, you had a camera.
Kelly: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God...
Ryan: It's only temporary, okay? Don't get excited.
Kelly: I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't...
Michael: Well ultimately I went into business to inspire people. They say those who can't do, teach. I can do both. I teach doing.
Jim: OK, here we go... Digest of business terms, CliffsNotes on business economics, and a sales encyclopedia.
Michael: Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
Jim: Those are the books that sum up the other books.
Michael: So no?
Jim: What are you reading?
Michael: Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.
Jim: Oh, that could be interesting.
Michael: No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
Jim: [clears throat] I am ready.
Michael: Don't do what I say, say what I do.
Jim: Five.
Michael: Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
Jim: Hmm... Five.
Michael: This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
Jim: No, I got it.
Creed: [motions to phyllis's desk]
Stanley: She's on her honeymoon. She won't be back for six weeks.
Creed: I'll wait. [sighs]
Meredith: Here's a joke for you. Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Angela: Don't Meredith.
Meredith: You ready?
Oscar: You know I don't like to participate in the...
Meredith: Why did Pam hook up with Roy at Phyllis's wedding?
Oscar: Really, it's just that I don't like to participate...
Meredith: Grow up.
Oscar: It's just... I'm sorry... It's gossip, and I don't think it's healthy.
Meredith: Get over yourself.
Oscar: Well, I'm not going to get over myself... it's wrong.
Meredith: Because Roy use to... [long censor beep]... with the rice... [long censor beep]... [laughs]
Oscar: [laughs] That's disgusting.
Meredith: [still laughing] I know.
Michael: Everybody please stand, and get up on your desks. [goes to stand on desk] Just stand right up.
Ryan: Michael it's not... It's not...
Michael: That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.
Michael: I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.
Michael: Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers. Something you have to keep in mind, you must, and you might want to jot this down, you must sell the stickers for more than you bought the stickers for.
Student 1: How have you adopted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world?
Michael: Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you this: How many people exist in the world? Over forty billion. What are they going to be writing on... rocks? Any one else? [points] Yep.
Student 2: Just following up on that first question...
Michael: No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.
Student 2: OK.
Michael: OK.
Student 2: New question.
Michael: Very good.
Student 2: In the digital age...
Michael: OK.
Student 2: ... email...
Michael: Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.
Student 3: Do you believe your high fixed cost are warranted given your diminishing market share.
Michael: How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.
Karen: [Karen sees Pam's art show flyer on the cabinet door, she looks around to make sure no one is looking, then proceeds to rip in down, Oscar comes out of the bathroom, Karen acts like she was just looking at it and then walks out of the kitchen]
Dwight: BAT!
Meredith: [comes out of the bathroom... screams... runs back into the bathroom]
Dwight: What is a leader? I asked Jim that, and he said he had never heard the word before. In America, in 2007. He said he knew the word ladder... What an ignoramous.
Meredith: [Bat hanging from ceiling cleaning itself] I really want to come out.
Dwight: You want rabies? Be my guest.
Pam: [looking with Kevin at the art show flyer] Should be fun.
Kevin: Your name looks really nice.
Creed: Goodnight Mary-Beth.
Kelly: Hope she's OK.
Angela: Just goes to show the power of prayer.
Kelly: You prayed for this?
Angela: In a general sense.
Kenny: So cool you're back with Roy. Maybe we can rent that cabin on the lake again this summer.
Pam: Yeah, that'd be nice.
Kenny: There'll be two of you and only one of me this time, since Denise left me. So I think it's fair I only pay a third.
Pam: Yeah that seems fair.
Michael: Can you confirm that the straps are tight?
Dwight: Yes. But this [pulls at straight jacket] seems to be...
Michael: And now, the chains.
Michael: A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.
Michael: MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.
Dwight: I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Michael: No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
Jim: Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you?
Michael: I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
Pam: So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?
Michael: No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]
Michael: AHHHH!
Kevin: Is everything ok, Michael?
Michael: Yes.
Michael: I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...
Michael: Alright.
Dwight: [trumpet sounds]
Michael: Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm.
Jim: Another worm? Like, are they friends?
Dwight: It's early bird gets the worm.
Michael: Pam, would you smell my breath?
Pam: No, no.
Dwight: Let me smell. [Michael breathes at Dwight] Good, not great.
Michael: Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.
Michael: Jimbo, last chance to carpool.
Jim: Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Michael: Sure? Might be a good idea.
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Jim: Thanks.
Michael: Play some games?
Jim: Oh. Um. I think we're good.
Michael: I spy?
Jim: Yeah.
Jim: Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?
Dwight: Thanks for inviting me along.
Michael: Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going? [phone rings] Heh-woh you.
Jan: Michael?
Michael: Hey, Buttercup.
Jan: Hi.
Michael: I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
Jan: Let's just blow this party off.
Michael: That's what she said.
Jan: Am I on speaker phone?
Michael: Uh, yes you are.
Jan: Is anybody else in the...
Dwight: Hello, Jan.
Jan: Hi, Dwight. Ok, Michael, take me off speaker phone.
Michael: No problem. [doesn't turn off speakerphone]
Jan: Ok. Let's just go to a motel...
Michael: Ok.
Jan: ...and just like rip into each other like we did on that black sand beach in Jamaica.
Michael: Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
Jan: Still on speaker?
Michael: Ummm... I don't know.
Jan: Are camera's there?
Michael: Maybe.
Jan: See you soon.
Michael: Ok.
Dwight: Talk to you later, Jan.
Michael: Alright. Bye.
Pam: Hey, Michael left early, so a bunch of us are going to go to Poor Richard's for happy hour. You should come.
Roy: I can't. My brother, he just unloaded the jet ski's and kinda took a bath, so... we're going to go get hammered.
Pam: Ok, well, we're going to a bar. Hey. You have to come to stuff with me. I'm serious! If you're going to be my boyfriend, you have to do boyfriend things.
Roy: Ok.
Pam: I have decided that I'm going to be more honest. I'm going to tell people what I want. Directly. So, look out world, cause ol' Pammy is getting what she wants. And, don't call me Pammy.
Michael: Beauty. Thank you sir!
Dwight: Salad.
Michael: Thank you.
Dwight: You dressed exactly like the servants.
Michael: Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
Dwight: Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
Michael: I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Dwight: That would have been really embarrassing.
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Crisis averted.
Michael: Ok.
Pam: Oh, that duck is so cute.
Kevin: Hey Pam.
Pam: Hey guys.
Kevin: Oscar. Angela.
Michael: Hi.
Michael: Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.
Michael: Oh, um, potato salad.
Dwight: It's from both of us.
Michael: No, it's not.
Rachel: Wonderful, let's, ah, see where we can put this. Ok.
Michael: Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
Michael: It's been sitting in my car all day. Sun beating down on the mayonnaise. Just, you never know.
Pam: Kevin, you and Stacy set a date yet?
Kevin: Yeah.
Kelly: Oh my God, when is it?
Kevin: It's complicated. I would appreciate some space on this.
Roy: Hey.
Pam: Hey. You made it.
Roy: You said it was important, so... How's it going?
Kenny: What's up, Pam.
Pam: Hey Kenny, sorry about the jet skis.
Roy: You guys, uh, want a round, on me?
Everyone: Yeah.
Roy: Yeah? Get you a drink.
Kenny: Thanks man.
Angela: No thank you, Roy.
Dwight: Oh, you know that line on the top of the shrimp? That's feces.
Michael: What are you looking for? You bring dip?
Jan: I'm sure that it's catered. I need you to sign these, Michael. It's a waver of some of your rights. You should read it carefully. It releases the company in the event that our relationship, in your opinion or in reality, interferes with work. You get a copy, I get a copy, and a third copy goes to HR.
Michael: Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
Jan: You realize this is a legal document that says you can't sue the company.
Michael: Over our love.
Jan: I've never told you that I love you.
Michael: You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
Jan: I am taking a calculated risk. What's the upside? I overcome my nausea, fall deeply in love, babies, normalcy, no more self loathing. Downside? I, uh, date Michael Scott publicly and collapse in on myself like a dying star.
Jan: What's this over the 'i'?
Michael: It's a heart.
Jan: Why is this so hard? That's what she said. Oh my God. What am I saying?
Michael: I love this woman!
Jan: Oh, no. Michael, please. Michael, please.
Dwight: Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica?
Dan Gore: No.
Dwight: No? Then you are an idiot.
Rachel: Hello Michael.
Michael: Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
David: Jan, glad you could make it.
Jan: Of course, of course, David. Do you remember Michael Scott?
David: Of course I do.
Jan: From the Scranton Branch.
Michael: Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Jan: David, can I, um, speak to you privately for just a moment, please.
Rachel: Excuse me.
Michael: Ok.
Pam: [looks at beers] Oh. [Starts to walk away, turns around] No. Actually, one of these is supposed to be a lite.
Bartender: Oh, sorry.
Man: So did the merger go smoothly, or?
Michael: It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
Karen: I'm the only one left. Everyone else was either fired or quit. And there is one in Anger Management.
Michael: Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
Jan: We're good. [Michael tries to kiss Jan] Michael, stop. Please stop that, ok?
Rachel: Can I get anyone anything, or?
Michael: I could go for an appeteaser.
Jan: Martini please.
Michael: Bagel bites or something.
Karen: Rachel, your house is beautiful.
Rachel: Thank you.
Dwight: What's the square footage?
David: About 5,000.
Dwight: Does that include the garage?
Michael: Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
Dwight: I'm just...
David: I don't know
Dwight: It's a common question.
Michael: David, how much did this house cost?
Dwight: These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
Rachel: I'll show you around.
Dwight: Cool, let's start with the banisters.
Karen: Hey, do you see that guy behind you in the blue blazer against the wall?
Jim: Yep.
Karen: That's Drake. And just so you know, I don't want to be weird or anything, but we use to date.
Jim: Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me.
Karen: And it didn't end well.
Jim: Gotcha. Alright.
David: This was a gift from Lee Iacocca. Twenty year old, single malt scotch.
Michael: Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean. [takes sip, coughs violently]
Jan: You ok?
Michael: Yeah. Do you have any ice?
David: Sure.
Michael: How about some Splenda?
Roy: One, two, three, up Jenkins! Down Jenkins. Oh, I think I heard the quarter over here.
Kenny: Where?
Roy: On this side.
Kevin: No, it is definitely under one of these hands. [points to Meredith and Kelly's hands]
Ryan: I think I heard it on Roy's side.
Kevin: No, it is here.
Ryan: [tapping Meredith and Kelly's hands] Not here. Not here. Not here. Not here.
Kevin: Good thing you didn't listen to me.
Ryan: Yeah, close one.
Roy: [points at one of Stanley's hands and one of Pam's] Not here. Not here. It's either here or here. [Stares at Pam] Not here. [Points at Stanley's hand].
Kenny: YES!
Pam: Nice job.
Roy: I can read you like a book.
Pam: Oh yeah?
Roy: You can't keep anything from me.
Student 1: Hey Creed.
Creed: Hey! What are you guys doing here?
Student 2: You're the man buddy.
Creed: I run a small fake ID company from my car with a laminating machine I swiped from the sheriff's station.
Dwight: Huh. [Bangs on wall] Yeah, these studs are way too far apart. What's in here? [Opens door].
Rachel: Uh, that's a guest room.
Dwight: Just the one window?
Rachel: [phone rings] Oh. I must get that. You'll have to excuse me.
Dwight: Are those real pearls?
Rachel: Uh, yes.
Dwight: [tests smoke detector] Good.
Jim: Well, it was nice meeting you guys. Take care.
Karen: Well, if you're wondering why his wife was staring daggers at me, it's because I kinda saw him for a little bit while they were separated.
Jim: Oh. Hadn't noticed.
Karen: Really? I thought it was so obvious. I'm glad it didn't make you uncomfortable.
Jim: No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Michael: This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.
Jan: It's nice.
Michael: You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
Jan: I, Michael, I think David probably wants to spend Christmas here with his family.
Michael: Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
Jim: Oh.
Michael: Crazy.
Jan: I'm sorry. You're just going to have to excuse us for just a couple minutes.
Michael: Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
Jan: Sorry. Michael, come here. Just, just, just, just. [kisses Michael]
Michael: What are you doing?
Jan: Don't you know what I'm doing?
Michael: Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
Jan: Shut up.
Michael: What has gotten into you?
Jan: Come on.
Michael: No, no, no.
Jan: What?
Michael: Come on, let's go back to the party.
Jan: Just let me loosen my dress.
Michael: Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
Jan: Michael.
Michael: No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
Jan: Slam me up against the wall, right here.
Michael: I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
Jan: Oh, please.
Michael: You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
Jan: Oh, I'm acting inappropriate? Get out.
Toby: Here. [hands Pam a duck stuffed animal]
Pam: Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.
Toby: I was...
Pam: Hey, don't you have a daughter?
Toby: [takes duck back] Yes.
Dwight: Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?
Child: I don't know, it was here when I was born.
Dwight: I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?
Child: I don't know.
Dwight: What do you know?
David: God, I hate these parties. Do you want to sneak out back and shoot some hoops? Meet me outside in two minutes.
Jim: You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.
Karen: Ok. Oh, um, don't mention that you and I are dating cause I think he might still have feelings for me.
Jim: Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.
Karen: I so got you.
Jim: So, none of them?
Karen: Of course not. I mean, you're kind of like, my first.
Jim: Really?
Karen: Oh my God, it's so easy. Fun.
Jim: Ok.
Karen: Hey Jan.
Jan: Not too good.
Rachel: Did you get a chance to try Michael's homemade potato salad?
Michael: Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.
David: What's ah, what's with Jan and Michael?
Jim: I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.
Dwight: The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.
Roy: What?
Pam: I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.
Roy: That's awesome. That's what I want.
Pam: Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.
Roy: I didn't do anything. Ask anyone, I totally could have and I didn't at all.
Pam: Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.
Roy: What?
Pam: He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.
Roy: Jim came on to you?
Pam: Just listen.
Roy: No, I am listening! That's the problem I am listening!
Pam: Don't yell!
Roy: Don't yell?!
Pam: This is over.
Roy: Yeah, you're right. This is so over. You kidding me, Pam!? Come on! God!
Kenny: Damn jet skis!
Michael: Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...
Jan: I feel sick.
Michael: You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
Jan: No, we were good when we were just running around, you know, in secret. It was wrong and it was exciting. Maybe it was a mistake to take it public.
Michael: Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
Jan: Please don't cry.
Michael: I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
Jan: It was never a love contract, Michael and besides, I have already given a copy to David and it would be just as embarrassing to get it back as I was handing it to him.
Michael: I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
Jan: I didn't mean it. I was...
Michael: Whatever.
Jan: Tired. I'm tired. And I didn't eat enough. And, and, that's all. That was it.
Michael: That's all, you didn't mean it?
Jan: That's all. I didn't mean it. That's all. I'm just saying I didn't mean it.
Michael: I love you, Jan.
Jan: Ok.
Dwight: Don't break up you guys, you're great together.
Roy: Are they going to call the cops?
Kenny: No, I paid them off.
Roy: Jet ski money?
Kenny: All of it.
Roy: I'm gonna kill Jim Halpert.
Karen: I think it's great that Jim's invited. It's important to have contact with the New York execs, or they'll think everyone here is like Mi...chael.
Roy: [Points to Pam's painting of the building] [laughs] You gotta sign that.
Pam: [laughs]
Roy: No you gotta put your name in the corner.  I've seen that artist do that.  Its good too, cause like you can know who paints what, you know.
Ryan: Hey, are you going to Poor Richard's?
Toby: I don't know, you?
Ryan: Maybe.
Kelly: I'm going and so are both of you.  We're all going.
Ryan: Hey, isn't there some rule against inter-office dating?
Toby: [whispering] I am not doing your dirty work for you.
Kelly: I hear whispering.
Jim: Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.
Pam: Yes boss.
Karen: See ya Pam.
Kevin: Oscar, Angela?  I didn't think you guys would come.
Angela: Why wouldn't we come?
Kevin: Because of reasons...
Kevin: Are there carbs in vodka?
Waiter: Hey folks, what can I get you?  Oh, hey Meredith.
Meredith: Hey
Waiter: Another vodka?
Meredith: Yeah.  Jack, these are my co-workers.
Kevin: Sup?
Waiter: [pointing to each correct person] Ryan, Pam, Stanley, Kelly, Kevin, Creed. How'd I do?
Stanley: Hmm, come here much?
Oscar: These wings are all fat and bone.
Angela: This place is disgusting. [They smile at each other]
Dwight: Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?
Rachel: I don't know that.  I'm sure the architect passed away many years ago.
Dwight: How convenient.
Jan: I am attracted to weird, wrong men.  I dated a violent karate instructor and then an unemployed fireman.  Life has been complicated.  I've made some decisions that I'm not proud of; my marriage, being overly litigious with my family.  I orgasm fairly easily. Michael was kind of like my dirty secret, you know, having sex with him, oh I was just turned on by my own degradation.  Um, why, anyway, I was told by somebody recently that I respect that I'm old enough to have a mature relationship, and that's what this whole evening is about and I have high hopes.
Melissa: [at the door] Hi Ryan.
Ryan: Hey.
Melissa: How are you doing?  I've, I've missed you.
Ryan: I've missed you too...
Melissa: Don't you remember me?
Ryan: Um, you ah, you gotta give me a hint.  Um, did you meet me at the gym?
Melissa: No.
Kelly: [still at the table] Who the hell is Ryan talking to?
Ryan: [at the door] Are you a client of Dunder Mifflin.
Melissa: No.
Stanley: [at the table] Oh, not again.  Melissa!
Melissa: Daddy.
Stanley: Wait for my outside.  [To Ryan] She is sixteen years old.  What is wrong with you?
Ryan: Okay, okay.  Stanley, let me explain to you what happened.
Stanley: No, no, no, no.
Ryan: She came right up to me just like she did when you brought her into work.
Stanley: No, no, no. You planned this whole thing boy.  I'll snatch your spine out your back.
Dwight: Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?
Michael: What a weird day.  I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they're the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.
Karen: So do you want to see it or not?
Jim: I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
Karen: Oh my God, you're like, agoraphobic.
Jim: Agoraphobic?
Karen: Yeah.
Jim: Really?
Karen: Yeah!  You would rather sit on your couch and watch a Phillies game, than go out to a movie with your awesome girlfriend.
Jim: Absolutely correct.
Kevin: Later, Jim.
Jim: Kev, have a good weekend.
Karen: Bye.  Ok, so this is what's gonna happen.  You're gonna suck it up.
Jim: Here we go...
Karen: ...and we're gonna go to dinner.
Jim: Ok...
Karen: And then we're gonna go to the movies.
Jim: Sounds good.
Roy: Hey Halpert!
Jim: Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim]
Pam: ROY!
Karen: [shrieks]
Pam: Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy]
Roy: [screams in pain] Ahh God!
Dwight: Pam, please call security!
Dwight: Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]
Michael: No need for consternation, everything is under control.
Jan: Michael, last Friday one of your employees attacked another employee in your office!
Michael: It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
Jan: [sigh] Is Toby there?
Michael: No...
Toby: I'm... here, Jan.
Jan: Ok, what... what is the situation Toby?
Toby: Well, we fired Roy, obviously.  And Jim won't press charges against Roy or the company.
Jan: Thank God.
Toby: Yeah, um, but now apparently Darryl has some issue with his...
Michael: No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
Jan: All right, well are you gonna take care of this?
Michael: Yeppers.
Jan: What did I tell you about 'yeppers?'
Michael: I don't... remember.
Jan: I told you not to say it.  Do you remember that?
Michael: Yeesh...
Pam: I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It
Jim: I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.
Jim: Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.
Dwight: Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Jim: Okay.  Um... Got you something.
Dwight: Don't want it.
Jim: You don't know what it is.
Dwight: Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
Jim: It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.
Dwight: No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.
Oscar: Angela, Roy's check.  He's coming in later to pick it up.
Kevin: Man, I cannot believe I missed the fight.
Oscar: It was crazy.
Angela: You saw it?  Describe it please.
Oscar: Well, I heard some shouting.  And I look over and Roy's by reception and you could just tell he's gonna punch somebody.  Jim says something.  Roy stomps over there.  All of the sudden, BAM.  Roy goes down, and Dwight's standing there like an action hero.
Angela: Oh...
Oscar: It was insane!
Angela: [flustered] Well... good for Dwight.
Michael: Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.
Jim: Where'd you get that?
Michael: Wikipedia.
Michael: Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.
Michael: Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.
Jim: Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
Michael: Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish]
Jim: I can't hear you.
Michael: What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]
Jim: Still nothin'.
Michael: Ok, see what I did?
Jim: No.
Michael: By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
Jim: Nice.
Michael: Ok, let's try another one.  Um...
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
Jim: And what happens in this one?
Michael: It's a surprise.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
Jim: Can I have a raise?
Michael: [gets up and begins to walk out of the room]
Jim: [softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
Michael: What?
Jim: What?
Michael: No, what did you say?
Jim: I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Michael: Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
Dwight: I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.
Toby: Which is where?
Dwight: Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
Toby: Thanks Dwight.
Kelly: That is the bravest thing I have ever heard.
Ryan: I can't imagine what I would have done.
Kelly: I can.  You would have left me to fend for myself.  Like that time we were on the Ferris Wheel and that kid dropped a milk shake on me and you just laughed.
Ryan: Well that was funny, that's why.
Kelly: Oh it was?
Ryan: Mm-hmm.
Kelly: Okay, well the next time that you get scared, that you think a murderer's in your apartment in the middle of the night...
Ryan: Okay.
Kelly: ...and you call me, to calm you down...
Ryan: You know what?  I didn't---
Toby: Can you stop...
Kelly: ...you can just call somebody else 'cause I'm not gonna do it anymore, Ryan.  I'm not.
Toby: There's a bunch of people back here, maybe...
Ryan: Well, don't talk to me about calling people in the middle of the night...
Toby: Guys...
Kelly: I call you in the middle of the night to tell you that I love you!
Toby: I don't think Michael intended to punish me, by putting Ryan back here with Kelly.  But, if he did intend that?  Wow.  Genius.
Michael: [knock on door] Yeah.
Darryl: You ready for me?
Michael: Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
Darryl: Cool.
Michael: You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.
Darryl: Okay.
Michael: No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
Michael: Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off.
Michael: Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.
Michael: [long pause] I am declining to speak first.
Darryl: Okay, I'll start.  It's pretty simple really. I uh, I think I deserve a raise.  I'm scheduled to get one in six months, but I'd like that to be moved up to now.
Michael: Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
Darryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes?
Michael: What?
Darryl: Are you wearin' lady clothes?  Those look like lady... pants.
Michael: No, this is a power suit.
Darryl: That there's a woman's suit.
Michael: [Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.
Darryl: I'ma call Roy, man.
Michael: Ohh... kay.
Darryl: This is gonna make him feel better.
Michael: All right.
Darryl: This is too good.
Michael: Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
Pam: Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!
Kevin: You're wearing a woman's suit?
Michael: No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
Michael: There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit.  At the very least it's bisexual.
Kevin: Who makes it?
Michael: Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
Phyllis: Look, it's got shoulderpads, and did you see that lining?
Michael: Okay.
Phyllis: Did you see...
Michael: Would you stop it, please?
Jim: So, none of that tipped you off?
Michael: It's European, OK?  It's a European cut.
Pam: Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.
Michael: No, they don't.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]
Pam: [Laughing, covering her mouth]
Michael: Italians don't wear pockets.
Pam: It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.
Karen: Hey, maybe you want to come over and raid my closet?
Michael: No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
Darryl: Yeah, he look like Hillary Clinton.
Michael: Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
Darryl: Okay, can you just stand right there?  [snaps camera phone picture] I gotta send some e-mails.
Michael: Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.
Kevin: Karen, how do you feel that Roy tried to kick your boyfriend's ass over another woman?
Karen: I feel great, Kevin.  Thank you.
Stanley: You must have been scared out of your mind.
Karen: Well, you know it happened so fast I didn't really have time to be scared.
Angela: What happened, exactly?  I wasn't here, so I haven't really heard the whole story.
Karen: Um, well, Jim and I were talking and Roy walked in looking super angry.
Angela: Mm-hmm.
Karen: And he's a big dude, you know?  And all of a sudden, Jim pushed me out of the way, and Roy cocked his fist, and then bam, Dwight sprays him and knocks him on his butt.
Angela: [flustered] Goodness.
Karen: When I heard Jim and Pam had kissed, my reaction was to have lots of long talks with Jim about our feelings.  Roy just attacked him.  I'm not sure which one Jim hated more.
Michael: Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.
Darryl: Well, it's simple Mike. I mean we merged these two branches right?  So now we're shipping twice as many orders as we used to.  With Roy gone we got a smaller crew.  And I'm pickin' up all of his slack, so I think I should be compensated fairly, by gettin' a raise.
Michael: [mumbles jibberish]
Darryl: What?  I can't hear you.
Michael: [mumbling softly] That was a very good point.
Darryl: I can't--- what, Mike?  Are you---
Michael: [mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.
Pam: Sorry I almost got you killed.
Jim: Yeah, that was nuts.
Pam: He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?
Jim: No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
Pam: Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.
Jim: We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
Pam: Jim... I am really... sorry.
Jim: Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.
Michael: I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.
Darryl: Why can't I just... tell you?
Michael: Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.
Darryl: There you go.
Michael: Oh. [scoffs] Come on.  Be serious.
Darryl: I am serious, Mike.  That's a 10% raise.  That's what I want.
Michael: I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
Darryl: Come on, be for real Mike.
Michael: I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
Darryl: [laughs] Are you serious?  You're earning this?
Michael: Plus perks, yes.
Darryl: Mike, this is barely more than I make.  You been here ten years, dog. [laughs]
Michael: Fourteen years.
Darryl: Ho-ho!
Michael: No, please, please...
Darryl: Oh, I'm sorry Mike, some of my folks got to hear about this one.  [texting on cell phone] Ah. [laughs]
Michael: Ok, let's take 15, again.
Michael: A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.
Jim: Ok, if you don't want a gift, at least let me buy you a beer, or lunch or something.
Dwight: When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
Jim: Boy I---
Dwight: No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
Jim: It's like when he annoys me and I want to screw with him to get him back, he never sees it coming.  But now, I want to be nice to him, and actually give him something, and he's like an eel.  I just can't grab onto him.  It's infuriating.
Karen: Maybe you just feel guilty about all the pranks.
Jim: Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Karen: Hmm...  I don't know.  Maybe you should go back out there and sell paper so we can go on a trip.
Kevin: Michael, here's the, uh, $15 I owe you.
Michael: Oh, thank you.
Kevin: Yeah.  I heard you might need it.  So...
Creed: Here's the $40 you gave me.
Michael: I didn't give you $40.
Creed: In a way you did.
Stanley: Yeah, I heard how much Michael makes.  I still think he's way overpaid.
Darryl: [on cell phone] Fourteen years.  Fourteen.  I know.  [laughing]  Ok, alright.  I gotta go.  Later.  [hangs up]
Michael: Okay.  Okay, here's the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
Darryl: What?
Michael: I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
Darryl: That's 'cause of you, Mike.  They're not gonna give the workin' man more than the boss.
Michael: Well what am I supposed to do?
Darryl: Get your own raise.  You gotta get out there and earn, son.
Michael: I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous.
Darryl: Well, when they merged the two branches together, they put
Michael: [exhales] That's true.
Darryl: Yeah that's true.  You gotta call your girl, and get paid.  Show her who wears the pants in the relationship.
Michael: You know what?  I should.
Darryl: Yeah, you should.
Michael: I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
Darryl: Fourteen years long.
Michael: You know what?  I deserve a bump.
Darryl: Make it happen, cap'in.
Michael: I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
Creed: I remember it was very late at night, like 11, 11:30.  Big fella comes in screamin' about God knows what.  I think maybe Halpert had stolen his car.  [Angela rolls her eyes] Something like that.  So the big fella pulls out a sock filled with nickels.  Then Schrute grabs a can of hairspray and a lighter---
Angela: You're useless.
Jan: Why don't we talk next month, after the quarter ends?
Michael: No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.
Jan: Today.  All right, well, uh, if you want to do it today, we should meet in person, and uh, can you get here by five?
Michael: Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I'll leave right away.
Jan: Great.  Uh, and listen.  Because of our, uh, our... you know, situation, we're gonna need to have a third party present.
Michael: Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
Jan: Da--- Darryl from the warehouse?
Michael: Mm-hm.
Jan: No, Michael. We, we need an HR rep.  So, uh, I think you should just bring Toby.
Michael: Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
Jan: Michael, he's your branch's HR rep...
Michael: [talking over Jan] No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
Jan: ...and we need someone else, in the room, because of our relationship.  You know this.  Michael, either Toby comes with you, or we don't do it.
Michael: [sighs] Fine.
Kelly: You are so mean.
Ryan: I don't know what you're talking about.
Kelly: Yes you do, Ryan Bailey Howard.  You called me stupid.
Ryan: No, I said your idea was stupid.
Michael: Toby, come on.  Let's go.
Toby: Where?
Michael: Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go.
Kelly: What is so stupid about wanting to name a baby Usher?
Toby: Alright.
Kelly: Usher Jennifer Hudson Kapoor.
Ryan: Don't you see why that's insane?
Kelly: Oh, so I'm crazy now?
Darryl: Comfortable, Mike?
Michael: Yeah.  Fine.
Darryl: How about you, man.  Comfortable?
Toby: No.
Michael: [imitating Chris Tucker] Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker.
Darryl: Thank you.
Michael: Well...
Darryl: I haven't been to New York in a long time.
Michael: Mm, the Big Apple.
Darryl: Maybe I'll stay overnight.  Got a cousin lives down there.
Toby: How would we get home?
Darryl: Oh you could stay too.  He's got a big place.
Michael: Maybe I'll stay.
Darryl: Mm, it's not that big.
Michael: Well...
Darryl: Busses, though.  They get you home quick.
Michael: [mouth full of pretzels] Oh, I...
Kelly: And all of a sudden, Dwight stood up and was like 'No!'
Angela: Then what'd he do? [Kelly's phone rings]
Kelly: You should just read the report that Toby did.  He took everyone's stories.  [answering phone] Dunder Mifflin, customer service, this is Kelly.  Oh yeah I could totally help you with that.  Ok, let me just get the folder out.  Okay, it seems here that you ordered 12,000 reams of paper.  Oh, 12 reams...
Hunter: Hey guys, Jan is ready for you.
Darryl: Okay, bring it home now.  And don't forget the new black man phrase I taught you.
Michael: Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
Darryl: Yes sir.  Remember that.  I'll be right outside if you need me
Michael: All right.
Darryl: Yeah, I taught Mike some new phrases.  I want him to get the raise, I... just can't help myself.
Roy: [to Jim] Hey man, uh... I'm sorry. [Jim motions 'Don't worry about it'] [Roy receives his check from Angela] Thanks. [to Pam] Can I, like, see you after work for coffee, or... something?
Pam: I don't know.
Roy: Please.  I just got some stuff I gotta say to you. [Pam nods, meekly]
Kevin: [as Roy is walking out] Jim--- Roy--- Look out!
Jim: Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though.
Jan: Thank you, Hunter. [to Michael and Toby] Hello.  Come in.  [exhales] Ah, Okay.
Michael: Who's the boy toy?
Jan: That's my new assistant.
Michael: Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Jan: I have to call you the second I get a new assistant?
Michael: Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Toby: Hi, Jan.
Jan: Hi, Toby. [clears throat] First--- [Michael clears his throat] First off, Michael, this is a salary negotiation.  All matters regarding our personal relationship have to be set aside.  Are we clear?
Michael: Pippity poppity.
Jan: Right now we can offer you a 6% raise.
Michael: Six percent?  After all we've been through?
Jan: Oh, God.
Michael: I got you... jade earrings.
Jan: Michael---
Michael: No!
Jan: Michael---
Michael: No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex. [Toby begins to write] [to Toby] What are you writing, perv-ball?
Toby: Just preparing for the deposition.
Toby: This may be the first time that a male subordinate has attempted to get a modest scheduled raise by threatening to withhold sex from a female superior.  It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.
Roy: I'm so sorry, Pammy.  I really wasn't gonna do anything.  But then I... kept thinkin' about you two together, and...  I just thought you guys were really good friends, or... or maybe he was gay or somethin'... Not that that's wrong.
Pam: I'm sorry too.  I just, I think that we both made some bad choices.
Roy: So you gonna start datin' Halpert then?
Pam: Um... no.  No, he has a girlfriend.
Roy: Oh yeah... Wait a minute, you... broke off our wedding for the guy.
Pam: No, there were a lot of reasons.
Roy: But you're not even gonna try to go out with him? [Pam meekly shakes her head] I don't get you Pam.
Pam: I know.
Dwight: What's this?
Jim: What's what?
Dwight: Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  'Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute'
Jim: Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
Dwight: Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Jim: [under his breath] Didn't think you'd notice...
Michael: Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!
Jan: Okay, Michael.  Please, why don't we just take a break.  This is really going nowhere.
Michael: Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere.
Jan: Ok, Toby, how about if you...
Toby: Sure.
Jan: Great.
Jan: What's wrong with you?
Michael: Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
Jan: Okay, Michael.  I can offer you a 12% raise, but you have got to ask for 15.
Michael: Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
Jan: No, just... I just need you to ask for it, so I can record that you asked for it.  Okay?
Michael: Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
Jan: No.  But we can offer you 12.
Michael: But you just said 15.
Michael: Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  It's about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--
Jan: Michael!
Stanley: So you and Bob are looking at a historical house?
Phyllis: Mm-hmm, near the river.
Stanley: Mm, how many bedrooms?
Phyllis: Four.
Angela: Dwight.  Dwight.  I've been doing some very interesting reading.
Dwight: Really?
Angela: Mm-hmm.  Tales of bravery.
Dwight: Mm, good stuff.
Angela: Mm-hmm.  I was thinking tonight, we could... read it together.
Dwight: Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]
Jim: [scoffs] I... will never say a word.  And now, we are even.
Andy: I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.  [in a forceful voice] So look out Dunder Mifflin!  [laughs] [snaps] I mean, look out... in a fun way!  You know, not like, I'm gonna hurt you...
Andy: Hey guys!  Guess who's back! [Dwight pepper-spray's Andy] AHHH! [screams in pain] OH, GOD!
Dwight: No need to thank me.
Dwight: I am not a hero.  I am a mere defender of the office.  You know who's a real hero?  Hiro, from
Michael: Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.
Andy: Good morning, Pam.
Pam: Oh, welcome back, Andy.
Andy: Drew.  I'm Drew now.
Pam: Oh.  Drew.  Sorry.
Andy: Apology not... accepted.  Because it wasn't even necessary in the first place. [laughs]
Andy: Several weeks ago, Andy Bernard had an incident. [cut to shot of Andy punching a hole in the wall] But after five weeks in Anger Management, I'm back.  And I've got a new attitude.  And a new name.  And... a bunch of new techniques for dealing with the grumpies.
Andy: Mornin' Jim.
Jim: Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
Andy: Good.  Drew.
Jim: What's that?
Andy: Dr--- You can call me Drew.
Jim: No, I'm not gonna call you that.
Andy: Cool.  I can't control what you do.  I can only control what
Jim: Andy.
Andy: Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?
Dwight: Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.
Dwight: Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.
Jim: Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
Dwight: Ok, tell him that's not true.
Jim: Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
Andy: You guys...
Dwight: Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
Jim: [half-heartedly] Andy!  Nah, that's too far.
Dwight: Damn you.
Michael: Today is Safety Training Day.  Toby is leading ours upstairs.  Yeauck.  But, I am giving everyone a little bit of a treat.  We are going to listen in on Darryl's presentation to the warehouse.  And if I know Darryl, it gonna be zoppity.
Darryl: Now, this is the forklift.  You need--- [Michael rattles it] You need a license to operate this machine.  That means the upstairs office workers
Michael: Hmm.
Darryl: Should you drive the forklift?
Michael: I can, and I have.
Darryl: No! No no no no no!  I said
Lonny: You're not allowed to drive the forklift.
Darryl: It's not safe, you don't have a license.
Michael: Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  [points] Pudge has driven the forklift.
Madge: Madge.
Michael: I thought your name was Pudge?
Madge: No, it's always been Madge.
Michael: Okay.  Um, her.
Darryl: Her.  Yes, 'her' is qualified to work a dangerous machine.  You are not.  Okay?
Michael: Ah, fine.
Darryl: Do you understand that?
Michael: Yeeesh.
Darryl: We do safety training every year, or after an accident. ... We've never made it a full year.  This particular time, I was reaching for a supply box on the top shelf, when one office worker, who shall remain nameless, kicked the ladder out from under me and yelled...
Michael: [barely keeping his composure] 'Hey Darryl, how's it hangin'?!' [laughs]
Darryl: And I fell and busted my ankle.  I'm legitimately scared for my workers.
Darryl: The baler can flatten a car engine.  It can cut off your arm and crush your entire body without skipping a beat.
Dwight: Yeah!
Andy: It's on!
Darryl: How many people a year do you think get their arms cut off in a baler?
Michael: Bail'er?  I hardly know her.
Lonny: Dammit, Michael.  Pay attention, man.
Darryl: Anybody wanna take a guess?  Anybody?
Kevin: Five bucks says it's over 50.
Jim: You really wanna bet?
Darryl: Anybody?
Kevin: Ever since March Madness ended, I am so bored.
Guy: How many?
Jim: Ok, you're on.
Darryl: Ten people, Michael. Ten people.  Would you like to be one of them?
Kevin: [mouths] Damn...
Darryl: [in background] You have to be alert, and calm. And always careful...
Jim: No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Kevin: On what?
Jim: I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
Kevin: Nice.
Oscar: What are you guys talkin' about?
Darryl: These are very dangerous machines down here, and the upstairs workers,
Michael: Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
Darry: It would be the worst thing in the world!  It would!  Very much so.
Lonny: What the
Michael: It's a big red trash compactor!
Lonny: What are you---
Darryl: It's not a trash compactor!  It's a baler!
Lonny: Don't disrespect the baler!
Michael: Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
Darryl: No do not touch it!
Michael: ...would I go near---
Darryl: There is no occasion for you to go near this stuff, okay?
Michael: Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!
Toby: Ok, um, one thing that you're gonna want to look out for is carpal tunnel syndrome.  It's recommended that you take a ten minute break from typing every hour.  For your circulation, you're gonna want to get up out of your chairs and uh, and move around about ten minutes every hour.
Michael: Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
Toby: Um, yeah.  You're computer screen can be a big strain on your eyes, so uh, it's also recommended that you step away for about... about ten minutes every hour.
Michael: Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
Darryl: Take them at the same time.
Michael: Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
Toby: No, no.  Um, you always want to keep a sweater or cardigan of some sort, in case it gets drafty.
Ryan: What about a long sleeve T?
Toby: Well, that'll work.
Kevin: Long johns?  A shaw?
Toby: You know, anything that warms you.
Michael: Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'
Darryl: Thank God we only had a baler to deal with.
Lonny: Yeah, that dim light is a bitch, ain't it?
Michael: Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Darryl: Actually, you did.
Michael: Yes.  Okay, let's do another one.  This is a good one.  'A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---'
Toby: Sedentary.
Michael: Yes.  'Which can contribute to heart disease.'  Heart disease kills more people that balers.
Lonny: That's called having a fat butt, Michael.
Michael: Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
Lonny: Yeah, yeah.  That's, that's fat butt disease.  That's what you suffer from?
Michael: No.
Lonny: Fat butt disease, Michael?
Kelly: Excuse me, sea monster, you weigh like a thousand pounds.
Lonny: Yeah?  I bet you'd like to swim with this sea monster, wouldn't you?
Kelly: Ryan?
Lonny: Dude, tell your girl to shut up.
Kelly: What?!
Ryan: Kelly, you insulted the gentleman.  Please apologize.
Kelly: Are you kidding me?
Darryl: Alright, we outta here.
Michael: Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
Lonny: Yeah, but ours was real, Michael.
Darryl: That's what I've been trying to tell you, Mike.  It's serious down there.  We do dangerous stuff, man.  This is shenanigans, foolishness, Nerf-ball.  You live a sweet, little, Nerf-y life.  Sittin' on your biscuit.  Never havin' to risk it.
Michael: Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
Michael: Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men's Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I'd like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make 'em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  'Hello, I'm Michael.  Welcome to Men's Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example.
Kevin: [Pam is holding a jar of jellybeans] Ten.
Oscar: Really, ten?  That's your guess?  You're a professional accountant.
Jim: There's like ten green ones.
Oscar: Forty-two.
Jim: I'm gonna say fifty.
Karen: Fifty-one.
Jim: Oh, don't be that person.
Kevin: That is lame.
Karen: It's a strategy!
Pam: It's called being smart.
Karen: Thank you.
Kevin: Oh, geeze.
Pam: I don't know how the whole betting thing started, but it's fun.
Pam: Ten...
Jim: Kev's out.
Kevin: Damn it.
Pam: 47, 48, 49! Jim wins!
Everyone: Oooh! [Jim claps]
Kevin: That is not fair.  He has spent hours up here at reception with you.
Jim: Okay, okay.
Kevin: No, constantly.  Like, for
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?
Pam: I don't understand the question.
Michael: Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
Pam: Yeah...
Michael: I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Pam: It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.
Michael: Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
Pam: So, you're okay?
Michael: Indubitably.
Michael: They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.
Dwight: Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
Michael: I don't know, I don't know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
Dwight: Wolves.
Michael: Nn--- Depression.
Dwight: Visual aids.
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: A quilt.  Depression quilt?
Micheal: No time to sew a quilt.  ... I got it.  Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.
Michael: You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods]
Kelly: So then the next movie moves to the top of the queue.  So number five becomes number four, number six becomes number five, [Ryan checks his watch]number three becomes number two, etc, etc.  And let's just say that I just sent back
Ryan: I guess I forgot. [kisses Kelly, gathers up all the money]
Kelly: You're such a ditz.
Kevin: Ryan, well done.  Two minutes, forty-two seconds.  Additionally, Pam, you win ten because she said 'awesome' 12 times, and Jim, you win five because she mentioned six romantic comedies.
Dwight: [on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!
Michael: Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
Dwight: We measured it once...
Michael: Go buy some watermelons.
Dwight: Seedless?
Michael: Just...
Toby: [Creed takes a bite of an apple] Creed is eating an apple.  I found a potato.
Pam: Hey Creed.
Creed: Hey!
Pam: Hey.
Creed: Hello. [Jim replaces Creed's apple with a potato][Creed takes a bite of the potato]
Pam: Yes!
Kevin: Here you go. [hands money]
Toby: Nice.
Karen: I don't know this place as well as I thought I did.  I'm getting cleaned out.
Dwight: Ready?
Michael: Let's do it!  Drop that sucker.
Dwight: [drops watermelon, watermelon bounces off trampoline, onto a car, bursts, car alarm sounds]
Michael: BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
Dwight: Got it.
Michael: Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Dwight: We're not allowed to use the baler.
Michael: Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
Dwight: I'm on it!
Dwight: I'm temporarily lifting the shun.
Andy: Thank you.
Dwight: It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Andy: Anything.
Dwight: Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
Andy: You mean a moon bounce.
Dwight: What do you think?  You've got an hour.
Andy: I'm gonna need... I'm gonna need petty cash.
Dwight: Shunning resumed.
Andy: Do you, do you want a drawbridge?
Dwight: Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
Dwight: Oh yeah, this is much better.  Safer.  Excellent decision.
Michael: Yes, thank you for seeing that.
Dwight: When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Michael: I don't know if I wanna do this.
Dwight: Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
Michael: No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
Dwight: That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
Michael: Rock n' roll!
Dwight: Yeah!
Michael: That's right!  I am not thinking.
Dwight: [imitating the sound and playing an air guitar] Near near near near near!
Michael: Yes!  Yeah!
Dwight: [singing] Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
Michael: Woo!
Dwight: [singing] Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Michael: Woo!
Dwight: [singing] Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
Michael: I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point! [Dwight continues air guitar]
Dwight: [out of breath] Guys!  Listen up!  Michael is up on the roof, and acting strange!
Andy: Whoa!  What's the situation?
Dwight: [hesitates] Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Andy: Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?
Dwight: Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
Stanley: Is it nice outside?
Dwight: It's gorgeous.  Let's go!
Stanley: Do I need my jacket?
Dwight: No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
Ryan: Will I be too warm in a long sleeve T?
Dwight: Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
Dwight: [outside] Come on, hurry up you guys!
Michael: [on the roof] My life!  Oh, my life...
Dwight: [on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!
Michael: Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
Dwight: Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael: Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Dwight: Is that the last year the data was available?
Michael: Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
Dwight: Don't do anything rash!
Michael: Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Dwight: I didn't... [Dwight runs up to the side of the building] I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Michael: Okay... that's...
Dwight: you said to just...
Michael: That's the whole point, dummy.
Dwight: Okay, I'm on it!
Michael: Okay.
Dwight: Attention blue collar workers!
Pam: What are the odds that this is in any way real?
Jim: I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
Kevin: Okay, I'd like ten bucks on those odds.
Kevin: If someone gives you 10,000 to 1 on anything, you take it.  If John Mellencamp ever wins an Oscar, I am going to be a
Dwight: Michael's up on the roof and he's acting strange!
Michael: Oooooh, my life!
Dwight: Michael!  What's wrong?
Michael: Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
Dwight: Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael: Dwight, you ignorant slut.
Jim: Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.
Michael: And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Jim: Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.
Angela: This is just offensive.
Ryan: At least we're outside.
Creed: [zipping up his pants] Hey, check it out, there's a... there's a castle over there.
Jim: Oh my God, there
Dwight: No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Michael: Damn it.
Pam: Oh... God.  Oh my God, he's gonna jump.
Jim: Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
Pam: Yeah...
Jim: Hey uh, Michael.  Don't jump on the bouncy castle.  You can't do that, because you're going to get horribly, horribly injured.
Pam: Hey Michael!  I have a present for you, but you have to come down and get it.
Michael: What is it?
Pam: Come down and... open it and you'll see.
Michael: Dwight, find out what the present is.
Dwight: Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Jim: Dwight...
Pam: Dwight, what are you---
Dwight: Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Michael: Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
Darryl: Mike, this is the opposite of safety.  You jump, you're gonna serious hurt yourself.
Michael: You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
Darryl: Yeah, but I never said you had nothing to live for.
Michael: What do I have to live for?
Darryl: A lot... of things.  Uh, you, uh... What about Jan?  Lovely, lovely, lovely Jan, man.  It's goin' good, right?
Michael: It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
Darryl: Mike, you're a very brave man.  I mean, it takes courage just to
Michael: Do you really mean that?
Darryl: I couldn't do it. I--- I ain't that strong.  And I ain't that brave.
Michael: I'm braver than you?
Darryl: Way
Michael: I Braveheart.  I am.
Darryl: Come down, okay?
Michael: Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
Michael: An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That's the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can't say.  But, yes.
Andy: When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.
Kelly: Oh my God, these cookies have no flavor. How is that possible?
Kevin: They are the worst. Who's this Drew chick?
Phyllis: Drew isn't a girl... She's Andy.
Andy: Oh no, nobody likes my cookies. I'm so angry, argh I want to hit something. [laughs] Totally kidin' guys.
Andy: Little device I learned to diffuse tension, be the first to make fun of yourself, because if they make fun of you before you do... Then you might lose your mind.
Kevin: [pours the last of the coffee into his mug]
Andy: Ahhh... Is that the last of it?
Kevin: I'm sorry.
Andy: It's OK. I can't always have what I want, but I can always want what I have.
Kevin: Well, would you like a cup of no coffee? 'Cause that's what we have.
Andy: Is it fresh? [winks]
Kevin: Are you going to beat me up?
Andy: Umm... [draws back arm] No. [laughs]
Andy: People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.
Angela: [walks around Andy's new car keying it]
Michael: OK, come on everybody, go time. Pam let's go.
Pam: I thought I'd stay and answer the phones.
Michael: Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life. [whispers to camera] saved it.
Michael: Here we go.
Dwight: Come on.
Michael: Field Trip.
Dwight: Step lively. Single file everybody.
Michael: Like we're going to the science museum.
Dwight: Let's single...
Michael: Learn by touching.
Dwight: Single... OK.
Michael: I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.
Dwight: Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
Kelly: You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.
Ryan: Totally, we should both work out.
Kelly: Screw you.
Michael: Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...
Larry: Sir, could you please, please focus on Darryl?
Michael: I...
Larry: Try.
Darryl: Summing up.
Michael: Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.
Michael: We got beat today, Dwight.
Dwight: [sighs]
Michael: But it was not a fair fight.
Dwight: No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
Michael: It was the warehouse guys...
Dwight: Right.
Michael: ... Dwight, they embarrassed us...
Dwight: Argh!
Michael: ... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
Dwight: Ghaaa!
Michael: You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.
Michael: How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery
Michael: Those warehouse guys, think that we are all flabby, middle management, nerf balls. Well I'm going to show them that we have nerfs of steel. [winks]
Andy: [Michael, Andy, and Dwight are standing around a trampoline] You know guys, I recently learned some pretty cool stuff about the difference between feeling something and... acting on that thing.
Dwight: Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Michael: Yeah, Drew.
Andy: Yes bosses.
Michael: You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
Dwight: OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Michael: OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
Phyllis: [phone rings] Hello?  Hi Bob Vance. [laughs]
Karen: That's three times in ten minutes.
Stanley: Where's my five dollars?
Phyllis: You are my little teddy bear. I wantcha.
Stanley: I always knew my co-workers were annoying. I never realized I could profit from it. Go ahead Bob Vance, call Phyllis, all day.
Andy: [Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.
Michael: I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.
Creed: [talking through bullhorn] Michael, you can not fly, you can not, I've seen this too many times.
Kelly: Give me that thing, I want to try.
Jim: Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Kelly: I was just going to say that [yells toward Michael] you have a cute butt. Oh my God I did not just say that, did I just say that? Oh my God I'm so adorable.
Angela: I know the timings bad, but I hate to be a nudge, but there's stuff that he has to sign that needs to be mailed by four.
Dwight: OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
Angela: OK, it's three forty eight.
Jim: OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Ryan: Oh, no, I have no training in this sort of thing.
Jim: Come on.
Stanley: Don't play dumb, you know damn well what we talking about.
Jim: Come on. He'll listen to you.
Everyone: Come on Ryan.
Angela: Let's do it.
Dwight: Come on pretty boy.
Ryan: Michael, you have always taken a great interest in my career.
Michael: I will miss you the most Ryan.
Ryan: Oh, what is your deal man!? Seriously I don't get it.
Andy: Let me borrow that chief. Michael, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself. So don't jump just to prove anything to us. OK? That said, if you need to prove something to yourself, you should jump.
Jim: Oh!
Andy: Up to you.
Jim: No no no!
Andy: If you do jump, I want you to reach for the sky.
Pam: Hey!
Jim: OK. careful, thanks. [takes bullhorn from Andy]
Andy: Grab a comet and kiss the moon! Kiss it!
Kevin: See this is why you always take ten thousand to one. You never know.
Darryl: You own a convertible. Come on man that's, that's hot. Women love that stuff right?
Dwight: It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
Michael: Coal miners, crab fishermen, Dog the bounty hunter, all dangerous jobs. But also upper middle management. [takes deep breath] Wow! I could have fallen off a roof today... And you don't worry about falling off a roof when you work on a crab boat... And there are no roofs in coal mines.
Andy: [in parking lot] Goodnight Stanley. [sees his car is keyed, just nods his head]
Phone Salesman: Hi.
Pam: Good morning, can I help you?
Phone Salesman: Yes, I'm from Techstar about a new phone system for you.   I was wondering if I could talk to Michael Scott.
Pam: I'm sorry, he's not in right now.
Phone Salesman: Really? He's never around when I come by.
Pam: Shoot.
Pam: They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.
Phone Salesman: How about I make an appointment to come back?  That way, I know he'll be here.
Pam: That is a great idea.
Phone Salesman: Great.
Pam: [while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...
Jim: [approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Pam: There he is!
Phone Salesman: Oh, hi! Great.
Jim: Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
Michael: [coming out from his office] Hello, may I help you?
Jim: Jimbo!
Michael: ...Jim.
Jim: [impersonating Fonzie]  Ayyyy!
Michael: Ayyyy!
Pam: Ayyyy!
Michael: Ayyyy!
Jim: Ayyyy!
Dwight: [running from his desk] Ayyyy!
Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight: Ayyyy!
Phone Salesman: Ok.  I'm, uh, I'll be going.
Jim, Pam, Michael and Dwight: Ayyyy!
Michael: [laughing] What was that?
Pam: That was funny.
Michael: That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
Michael: Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?
Kevin: I miss Stacy.
Michael: Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting...
Kevin: I can't even imagine.
Pam: This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.
Jim: You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.
Pam: Really, Jim?  On Cupid's birthday?
Jim: Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.
Kelly: So, I received my first Valentine from a secret admirer.  [Kelly opens the envelope] Roses are red, violets are blue, it's time for your dental cleaning, and maybe a check-up too.
Michael: Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]
Michael: Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.
Michael: Pam, really, they're back?
Pam: I can't see them when they're on the floor
Jim: They're for her to look at, Michael.
Michael: Can I have a word with you, Jim?
Jim: Yes, let's have a word.
Michael: Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Jim: Oh, I'm sorry.
Michael: Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Jim: I understand that.
Dwight: So sexy it becomes hostile.
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Jim: Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
Michael: Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
Jim: We do.
Michael: --that none of us can be a part of--
Pam: You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.
Michael: [gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
Jim: That sounds fun.
Michael: So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
Dwight: Yeah, deal with it Pam!
Michael: So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
Dwight: Having trouble finding a vein?
Blood Drive Worker: Yup, a little.
Dwight: How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm]
Dwight: I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]
Michael: I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --
Blood Drive Worker: You're gonna need to lie down right over here.
Michael: Okay.  Hello.
Blood Girl: Hi, I cant talk right now.  I'm sorry.
Michael: Oh, OK.
Blood Girl: Whew, I'm really nervous.
Michael: Yeah, me too.
Blood Girl: Yeah, when I get nervous I sort of clam up.
Michael: Oh, well, that's fine.
Blood Girl: Whew, it's better for me just to be quiet, yeah.
Michael: Yeah, can I point something out to you?
Blood Girl: Sure.
Michael: You're actually talking a lot.
Blood Girl: Sorry, it's the other thing I do when I get really nervous.
Michael: Okay, here we go.
Blood Drive Worker: Alright, here we go.
Michael: Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat]
Blood Drive Worker: Just relax.
Michael: Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.
Blood Girl: Oh, that's gross.
Michael: Type O-Ocean Spray.
Blood Girl: God, stop.  Stop it.
Phyllis: Hey, why don't you guys come have lunch with Bob and me?  We'll take all afternoon. [whispering] Michael is terrified of bob.
Pam: What do you think?
Jim: I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Pam: We're in.
Michael: Yick.
Blood Girl: What?
Michael: I looked at the bag.
Blood Girl: Ew.
Michael: I looked straight at the bag.
Blood Girl: That's not good.
Michael: Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?
Blood Girl: Well, ok... bags! [Michael is taken aback] Alright, that was bad.
Michael: That was mean.
Blood Girl: Um, a hat.
Michael: A hat.
Blood Girl: A hat with no blood in it?
Michael: That is full of soup.
Blood Girl: You're cute.
Michael: What?
Blood Drive Worker: You're done.
Michael: Oh, already.
Blood Girl: Ah, we did it!
Michael: Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]
Blood Girl: Is he OK?
Michael: [ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]
Hank: What?
Michael: Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
Blood Drive Worker: Oh.  She left.
Michael: OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
Blood Drive Worker: I'm sorry sir we can't give out that information. [Michael sighs]
Meredith: [seeing Kelly tear a paper heart in half] What are you doing?
Kelly: Decorating.
Meredith: I'll help. [Meredith tears the wings off of a Cupid]  Now it's just a stupid baby.
Kelly: Yeah, thanks.
Phyllis: It is so nice to go out with another couple.
Pam: Anything to get out of that office.
Phyllis: I know
Bob: I honestly don't know how you can work with that jackass, that other jackass, and that new jackass.
Phyllis: He's talking about Michael, Dwight, and Andy.
Jim: Oh yeah, I understood.
Michael: Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?
Kelly: Well, his heart was in the right place.
Michael: Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.
Oscar: I don't think so.
Michael: Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
Oscar: I can't.
Michael: If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?
Bob: Everyone here who's bowled a 280 please raise your hand. [Bob does so]
Jim: No way, a 280?
Pam: Wow,  that's impressive.
Phyllis: Okay. Now everyone here who's bowled under 70 raise their hand.
Jim: Yikes.
Phyllis: Come on, Bob.  Raise your hand. [Bob does so reluctantly]
Jim: No.  Bob, no. No!
Pam: What?
Bob: One time. You love bringing up that one time, don't you?
Phyllis: Yes I do.
Pam: Jim uses a 6 pound ball.
Jim: That is a lie, that is a lie.
Pam: Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.
Jim: But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
Pam: No, you just have little dainty fingers.
Bob: Oh yeah.  You can always model ladies' jewelry.
Jim: Nobody asked, Bob!
Oscar: Do you risk telling him how you feel?  Do you say something that you can barely admit to yourself?
Angela: Oh God, what did you do?  I mean, not that I approve of any of it but...
Oscar: I was stupid, I told him.
Kevin: Was he in to you in like a gay way?
Michael: Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
Oscar: He told me he wasn't gay. [everyone groans]
Michael: Really sad.
Oscar: I'm not done yet.
Michael: Oh my God.
Kevin: A week later a friend of mine calls me up, and he says 'I just saw him in a gay bar in Kansas City.' [everybody groans except for Michael who looks pleasantly surprised]
Michael: Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Angela: My worst breakup was actually two breakups.  Two different men. I was in love with both of them and when things went bad they had a duel over me.
Oscar: Yeah, Dwight and Andy.  We were here.
Angela: No, this was years ago when I was living in Ohio.   John Mark and John David.
Oscar: Angela, you had two sets of different men actually duel over you?
Angela: I guess I have.  Huh.
Michael: Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?
Oscar: He's on one of his honeymoons.
Michael: What?
Oscar: He made non-refundable deposits on his honeymoons, so he's just knocking them off one at a time.  I think today he's hot air ballooning and later he's got a couple's massage.
Kevin: My worst breakup was with Stacy.  It was a Sunday morning, we were reading the paper, and I said 'Oh my God, I think the Eagles could clinch the NFC East!' and she said that we're done.
Michael: You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
Dwight: You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
Michael: No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
Dwight: A net? a giant net?
Michael: No.  Not a giant net.
Dwight: What do you have in mind?
Michael: I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
Dwight: Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
Michael: Old fashioned meet market --
Dwight: No.
Michael: -- I don't think it is.
Dwight: Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Michael: These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.
Michael: Hey.
Dwight: Hey.  No movement.
Michael: Ah, still early.
Dwight: Eh, its not that early.
Michael: [sighs] So how you holding up?
Dwight: I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.
Michael: No.  No, I meant about being single today.
Dwight: Oh.  Meh.
Michael: Meh, exactly.  Eh.
Dwight: Eh.
Michael: Oh, here we go.
Dwight: Hello.
Michael: Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]
Dwight: Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.
Michael: Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
Lynn: Oh, hi! I'm Lynn.
Michael: Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
Kevin: Hello.
Lynn: Hi.
Michael: [after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?
Kevin: I'm from here!
Michael: Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
Kevin: Thank you, Michael.
Dwight: I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.
Blonde: I- I- believe you.
Dwight: You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
Blonde: Um, I work at a place that does catalogs for community colleges and small businesses.
Dwight: You must use a lot of paper.
Blonde: Oh God tons of it .
Pam: What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?
Jim: I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Pam: Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.
Jim: Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.
Pam: Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.
Jim: We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]
Kevin: At the Circle Drive-In they show old movies.  It's really cool.
Lynn: That does sound cool.
Kevin: I used to go there with my fiance [Lynn is taken aback]. Before she left me [Lynn shows pity].   No, I mean, before I left her [Lynn looks confused].  She left me.   [Kevin walks away dejected]
Kevin: I think I blew it.  It all happened so fast.   So... fast.
Michael: So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.
Eric: I am.
Michael: Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
Michael: It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.
Dwight: ...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?
Michael: No reason.
Dwight: Is somebody after you?
Oscar: Why do you always go to that?  Has anyone ever been after anyone in this office?
Dwight: Hey, it just takes one!
Michael: Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
Kelly: You met a woman when you were giving blood?  That is so romantic.
Michael: It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Kelly: Oh my God, that makes it even more romantic.  This is like a modern day Enchanted, it's like a fairy tale.
Meredith: She could be your soul mate.
Dwight: Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
Oscar: It's possible.
Kelly: She could be.
Michael: Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
Kelly: Aww. [Michael grins sheepishly]
Jim: Here they come.
Pam: [looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?
Jim: No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.
Pam: Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.
Jim: Oh great, I have to cover?
Pam: Do you think they dined and dashed?
Jim: Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
Pam: I thought we were having a nice time.
Jim: We were.
Pam: Yeah.
Jim: [emerging from the Men's room] Empty.
Pam: [exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate]
Jim: Oh boy.
Pam: My God.
Jim: OK.
Girl: Is this the party? [everyone turns to Michael wanting to know if this is Blood Girl]
Michael: Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Bob: OK then.
Jim: So...
Bob: Where were we?
Phyllis: [out of breath] Bowling.
Pam: Yep, that, yeah.
Bob: You didn't eat much there Jimbo.
Jim: Oh initially I did.
Bob: Want some meat?
Phyllis: Oh sure, a little piece.  Ooh, no mushroom though.
Bob: Forgot.
Phyllis: Yeah, thank you. [As Phyllis enjoys Bob's meat, Jim and Pam look knowingly into the camera]
Kevin: Hey, I'm sorry we did not have a chance to talk more.  I get very nervous talking to pretty girls.  Seriously, feel how sweaty my hand is.
Lynn: That's really sweaty.
Kevin: Are you on email?
Lynn: Oh, yeah. [gives Kevin her card]
Kevin: Cool. Bye.
Lynn: Bye, Kevin.
Kevin: Good Valentine's.
Dwight: So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.
Blonde: OK. [Blonde stands up to leave]
Dwight: OK, what's up?
Blonde: Look, I'm gonna go...
Dwight: Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
Blonde: Look, we already have a paper supplier.
Dwight: OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Michael: Hey, you don't deserve her.
Dwight: Thanks, Michael.
Michael: Hey, if anybody wants to go...
Oscar: We can stay a little longer.
Michael: Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks.
Kelly: Michael, it's time.
Michael: You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
Oscar: Come on, we'll all go.
Michael: [after some encouragement] OK.
Michael: Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.
Stanley: Pardon me, may I have a chocolate chip cookie?  I gave blood earlier and I'm still feeling woozy.
Blood Drive Worker: Of course. [noticing Stanley's arm] That's weird.  You got a cotton ball and tape and we've been using Band-Aids.
Stanley: [backing out of the bloodmobile] I, uh-oh I feel so woozy I just [to Phyllis] Band-Aids.
Phyllis: Damn.
Pam: [on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.
Michael: Pam?
Pam: [on the phone] Sure. Uh huh.
Michael: Pam? Knock, knock.
Pam: I'm on the phone.
Michael: I know you are. Knock, knock.
Pam: [on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--
Michael: [at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
Pam: 0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.
Michael: They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]
Pam: [sighs] Who's there?
Michael: Buddha.
Pam: Buddha who?
Michael: [puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]
Pam: Great.
Michael: I, I need something to wipe my hand.
Pam: Now there's, there's butter on my desk.
Michael: That was helping. It was classic.
Dwight: I got a knock-knock joke.
Michael: No... God.
Dwight: OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
Michael: Alright.
Dwight: [clears throat] Knock, knock.
Michael: Who's there?
Dwight: KGB.
Michael: KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face]
Dwight: [in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!
Michael: What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight]
Dwight: What are you doing?
Michael: What are you doing?
Dwight: Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
Michael: You, you like that?
Dwight: C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.
Michael: Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
Jim: Ding Dong.
Michael: [to Jim] Who's there?
Jim: KGB.
Michael: Dwight, get the door.
Dwight: I'm not answering it.
Michael: Answer the door.
Jim: Ding dong.
Dwight: No way, it's the KGB.
Jim: Ding dong.
Dwight: I'm not answering that. You answer it.
Michael: I'm not gonna answer it
Dwight: I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]
Jim: The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs]
Dwight: It's true.
Pam: [Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.
Michael: Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
Pam: Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.
Michael: Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
Pam: Jelly beans.
Michael: No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
Michael: The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.
Michael: I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.
Jim: We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
Michael: Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
Jim: Free paper.'
Michael: No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
Andy: Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...
Michael: No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
Kevin: I think I should call her.
Andy: No! No! No!
Kevin: Why is it so bad for me to call and ask her to lunch today?
Andy: [sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'
Kevin: But I do like her just the way she is.
Andy: Well that's not what we agreed on.
Jim: What are you doing?
Andy: Huh?
Jim: [to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.
Andy: No.
Pam: You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.
Andy: You're asking him to give up all of his power.
Jim: What power?
Kevin: Andy, Pam, and Jim are all telling me how to deal with this girl that I like, Lynn. I, I don't like getting advice from more than one person at a time. I'm a textbook over-thinker.
Andy: You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'
Pam: That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?
Jim: Well guys with girlfriends don't.
Andy: That's low, Tuna.
Jim: [on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]
Michael: Woo hoo.
Jim: [on phone] I'll take that down right now.
Michael: Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...
Jim: I'm on the phone.
Michael: ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
Jim: [on phone] Hold on one second.
Michael: Invite them on the tour.
Jim: [to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.
Michael: Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
Oscar: Ten percent?
Michael: Yeah?
Oscar: They're our largest client.
Michael: Yeah.
Oscar: It's gonna hurt.
Jim: [on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
Jim: How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?
Michael: I thought I did. So...
Jim: OK...
Michael: Well no harm no foul.
Jim: ...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Michael: You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
Michael: Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.
Darryl: Start over.
Michael: Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
Darryl: Were the boxes near each other?
Michael: Irrelevant.
Darryl: I put three pallets on the truck to Blue Cross once a week. They use a lot of paper.
Michael: OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
Michael: My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs]
Pam: Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.
Pam: When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.
Michael: Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?
Oscar: They can.
Michael: No, they can't.
Oscar: Yes, they can.
Michael: Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
Oscar: Michael, what do you think shutting down a branch is?
Michael: Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
Jim: So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.
Michael: Thank you, Jim is with me.
Jim: Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
Michael: Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
Creed: That's not why.
Michael: OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.
Pam: Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings]
Jim: Good one.
Michael: OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]
Stanley: I've got a golden ticket idea. Why don't you skip on up to the roof and jump off?
Michael: That is not constructive.
Pam: [on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.
Michael: [on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--
David: [on speaker phone] Michael, what the hell is going on here?
Michael: How are you doing?
David: Fine. What is going on?
Michael: [reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
David: Why did you OK this golden ticket idea? We're going to lose a fortune, Michael. How could you let this happen?
Michael: Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
David: How could you not know Michael?
Michael: I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
David: Might have hi--- OK, what firm?
Michael: You're breaking up.
David: Michael?
Michael: OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
David: Was it the sales department?
Michael: Yes.
David: Was it Jim?
Michael: No.
David: OK, was it Dwight?
Michael: [long pause] Yes.
Michael: [Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.
Dwight: That was your idea.
Michael: Woah, wow, who told you that?
Dwight: You did. Several times. Over and over again.
Michael: [same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
Dwight: [same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...
Michael: I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
Dwight: Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.
Michael: Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
Dwight: You don't keep a diary.
Michael: Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
Dwight: Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.
Michael: Why do you have a diary?
Dwight: To keep secrets from my computer.
Michael: OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
Dwight: Impossible.
Michael: Yes, you did.
Dwight: I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.
Michael: What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary]
Dwight: Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.
Michael: Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
Dwight: With all my heart.
Kevin: You guys are throwing a lot at me.
Jim: All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.
Kevin: Right.
Pam: I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.
Jim: No, that is what I mean.
Pam: [to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.
Kevin: [puts hand on Jim's hand] Like that?
Jim: No, stop it.
Andy: Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.
Andy: [Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.
Michael: We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--
Dwight: OK, what am I thinking right now?
Michael: Umm, nacho chips.
Dwight: No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.
Michael: Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
Dwight: Oh, not gonna happen.
Dwight: I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.
Michael: Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.
Dwight: What about Shoe La La?
Michael: [sighs] It's not ready yet.
Michael: I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.
Michael: May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.
Oscar: These aren't announcements.
Michael: Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
Dwight: I love working here and I do not want to leave.
Michael: He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
Dwight: Well...
Michael: I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
Dwight: We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.
Michael: Right.
Dwight: No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
Michael: That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
Dwight: Try me.
Michael: That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
Dwight: I haven't made a decision yet.
Michael: You kind of have.
Dwight: No.
Michael: Yes.
Jim: You cannot take the fall for him.
Dwight: He said he would do the same for me.
Jim: He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?
Dwight: I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.
Jim: There it is.
Michael: [seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.
David: That's too bad.
Michael: Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
David: Hopefully, nothing that can't be undone because Dwight I owe you an apology. The head of Blue Cross just called. They were so excited about the golden ticket discount that they have decided to make Dunder Mifflin their exclusive provider of all office supplies. Congratulations Dwight. [holds out hand for handshake]
Dwight: David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations]
David: I just want to say that this golden ticket idea is one of the most brilliant signs of initiative I have ever seen at this company and how about a big round of applause for Mr. Dwight Schrute? [everyone starts clapping]
David: Alright Dwight. This is huge.
Dwight: That's what she said! [David laughs]
Michael: Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
Dwight: Inspiration.
Michael: Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
Dwight: [same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.
Michael: Give me the details of how that happened.
Jim: You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
Michael: What?
Jim: And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.
Dwight: Apology rejected.
Pam: [going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.
Dwight: Oh Pam.
Creed: Good work, kid.
Dwight: Thanks old man.
David: This, this is great. OH, OK, look I want to get you on the horn with the marketing people in New York. The should meet you.
Dwight: Yeah.
David: Pam, could you set up a call in there in about 15 minutes, please?
Pam: Sure.
Michael: David? David?
Dwight: [same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...
Michael: David?
David: Yeah?
Michael: Could I be a part of the meeting also?
David: You probably have too much to do around here. I don't want to uh, take up your time with another meeting.
Jim: Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]
Dwight: Alright.
David: [on speakerphone] Hey guys, I have with me Dwight Schrute. Dwight, take it away.
Dwight: OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.
Man on phone: Wait, do you guys hear that? There's not a dog listening in, is there? [cut to show Michael on the other line] I hear panting.
David: No. No dogs.
Dwight: So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].
Michael: There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Pam: It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Dwight: Pam...
Michael: I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
Dwight: That is my idea.
David: [on phone] We are gonna call you back guys. [to Michael] What is going on here?
Michael: OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
David: No, no.
Dwight: It is my idea.
Michael: Oh how dare you.
Dwight: It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.
Michael: You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
Dwight: Horse Boat.
Michael: Oh please.
Dwight: A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
Michael: Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
Dwight: Oh give me a break.
Michael: ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
Dwight: That's because they're easy!
Michael: They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
Dwight: [same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...
David: [same time as Michael and Dwight] Guys, guys. OK, enough. Please, enough. What, is this true, Dwight? I mean, is this true?
Dwight: Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.
Michael: Thank You!
David: What, I don't -- what do you want me to do now, Michael? What am I supposed to do now?
Michael: Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
David: OK, uhh... I am going back to New York. Pam, do me a favor, don't send me those notes.
Pam: OK.
David: I am gone.
Michael: When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.
Dwight: Oh I am. In my own words.
Michael: I want to see it.
Dwight: No.
Michael: I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary]
Dwight: No, Michael.
Michael: Give me...  Give me the diary.
Dwight: No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand]
Lynn: Hi.
Kevin: Lynn, I'm just gonna say to you everything that I am thinking.
Lynn: OK.
Kevin: I think you have the best smile. I'd like to take you out to dinner and a movie.
Lynn: OK.
Kevin: Nice. [Both laugh] Boobs. [Lynn blushes]
Andy: Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!
Dwight: Ding dong.
Jim: Who is it?
Dwight: KGB.
Jim: Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.
Dwight: [in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?
Jim: Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.
Dwight: We have more houses to visit.
Jim: If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.
Dwight: We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?
Jim: I get back from work around 6.
Dwight: How about 5:15?
Jim: You can try. That, that might work.
Dwight: Very well, we will come back at 5:15.
Jim: Alright.
Dwight: Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.
Michael: I like it.
Dwight: Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
Jim: [wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Dwight: Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
Jim: I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
Michael: I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
Jim: And of course, classy.
Michael: And classy, yeah.
Dwight: Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
Jim: Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.
Dwight: Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]
Michael: [watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
Jim: That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Michael: Yes.
Dwight: Mr. Peanut is not classy.
Michael: He is.
Dwight: He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Michael: That's what makes him classy.
Dwight: Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
Jim: Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.
Dwight: Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.
Jim: Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.
Michael: Strawberries?
Jim: That's inspired.
Dwight: I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]
Pam: Not classy.
Michael: Not classy at all.
Jim: De class'.
Michael: French. Classy.
Pam: Hi, can I help you?
Charles: Yeah, I'm Charles Miner, here to see Michael Scott.
Pam: Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.
Michael: [on speakerphone] Yes?
Pam: Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.
Michael: Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Pam: Yeah, are you coming out now?
Michael: Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is.
Charles: I-I was-
Michael: Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Michael: What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
Jim: Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Michael: You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
Dwight: Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.
Michael: Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go! [swings arm above head for everyone to come, hits doorframe] Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Dwight: We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
Michael: Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.
Charles: Thank you.
Michael: Took me all night.
Pam: This is what you did last night?
Michael: I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa. And besides, the last two people to have his job were Jan and Ryan. The former was my lover, and the latter my best friend. So, who knows? I do. [in British cockney accent] It's gonna be mental! It's going to be mental.
Kelly: My god, he's like a black George Clooney.
Angela: Really? I don't see it. I mean, he's ok, he's not unattractive, it's. . .
Jim: Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.
Charles: Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Jim: I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.
Charles: Uh.
Jim: Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
Charles: Your name is Jim?
Jim: Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]
Pam: He just had to wear his tux today.
Jim: I thought it'd be funny.
Pam: Took him 40 minutes to get ready.
Michael: All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.
Charles: Hey, I come from accounting, too.
Michael: Oh, nerd alert!
Kevin: Ni-
Michael: This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
Charles: Hey, Oscar, it's good to meet you.
Michael: This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange [points to Andy]
Andy: Hey-o!
Michael: There you go! Where's the other?
Charles: You know, Michael, I don't need to know everyone's sexual history.
Michael: Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
Kevin: Hey!
Charles: How about I just say hi to everyone at one time?
Michael: Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner. [claps]
Charles: Thank you, Michael. Thank you for the C-shaped bagels.
Michael: Oh! Well...
Charles: That's great.
Michael: Above and beyond.
Charles: Hey, you know we're in tough times and we're not immune to this economy.
Michael: That's true.
Charles: But the goal is to, you know, fight our way through this.
Stanley: [clears throat, raises his hand] Stanley Hudson. Are there gonna be layoffs?
Michael: No. Absolutely not.
Charles: Uh, hold on, Michael, thank you. Uh, Stanley, you know, we can't make any promises, but we'll try everything in our power to avoid that.
Oscar: Do you have specifics?
Charles: Sp-Well, um, Michael should have filled you in last week.
Michael: Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
Charles: You didn't tell them.
Michael: Well, why don't-
Charles: Yeah, I will. What I told Michael last week-
Michael: Charles is going to tell you.
Charles: Is that we are cutting three percent across the board, which means we will no longer be matching 401k contributions. All overtime requests will need to come through the corporate office.
Stanley: Fantastic.
Michael: Well, it's not official.
Charles: It is official. It is official. And actually, guys, I'm encouraging branches to consider a freeze on discretionary spending.
Michael: Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
Charles: No, no, not salaries. Petty cash, supplies, and uh, you know, parties.
Michael: Well-
Dwight: What about your party?
Michael: Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
Charles: Michael, I'm going to stay for the day.
Michael: Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
Charles: No, it's a little bit more than that. I'm going to set up in here, ok?
Michael: I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.
Michael: [on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.
David: What gave you that idea?
Michael: It was my understanding.
David: I see.
Michael: Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
David: Look, Michael, Charles is very qualified. Get to know him. I really think the two of you are going to make a great team.
Michael: But the branch is still mine?
David: You're still the branch manager, yes, and if you need anything else at all, just let Charles know.
Dwight: Ask him about the party.
Michael: Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
David: I'll give it my best shot, Michael.
Dwight: No the other thing.
Michael: Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]
Dwight: He hung up?
David: No.
Michael: I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.
Charles: No.
Michael: Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
Charles: Saticoy Steel.
Michael: Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
Charles: No, I worked at a company called Saticoy Steel.
Michael: You're not from paper?
Charles: No.
Michael: Does David know this?
Charles: Yeah, he knows. He just wants a good manager.
Michael: Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
Charles: And what is that?
Michael: And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
Charles: That's not how I plan on doing things.
Michael: Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
Charles: I'll tell David what he needs to know. Sorry. David wants it this way.
Michael: Whatever David wants.
Charles: Ok.
Michael: [on phone] Michael Scott calling for David. Well, just tell him to call me ASAP as possible. Thanks.
Dwight: Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em. [calls back on speakerphone]
Stephanie: David Wallace's office.
Dwight: Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Stephanie: Good. Thank you.
Dwight: How's it hanging?
Stephanie: Alright. . .
Dwight: Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
Michael: No! You idiot! [hangs up] Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.  [redials]
Stephanie: David Wallace's office.
Michael: Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
Stephanie: Michael...
Michael: And I really really need to talk to David.
Stephanie: Please hold.
Charles: [on cell phone] Charles Miner. Hello? Hello, who is this? Who is this?
Michael: I was never given a name. [hangs up, he and Dwight sigh in relief]
Pam: [to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-
Charles: Oh, uh, Pam? Hey everyone, lunch is on me today.
Angela: That is so unnecessary!
Michael: Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
Charles: It's no big deal.
Michael: I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
Charles: You still have that option. [Michael sighs]
Angela: Thanks again, Charles.
Kelly: Thank you.
Michael: Nobody thanked me.
Jim: Thanks, Charles.
Michael: For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
Charles: I do this for every branch I go to. If you do not like it, then I think there are some bagels left over from this morning.
Michael: [on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!
Kelly: Should I seduce him?
Angela: No. No one wants to see that. [both smile at David]
Kevin: Michael?
Michael: Yep.
Kevin: I just realized that I used the 2008 calendar to do the spreadsheets for January and February. I may need to come in this weekend to fix it.
Michael: Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
Charles: Uh, no, sorry, Michael. No, Kevin, right? We're going to need you to do that during office hours.
Kevin: Ok.
Charles: Ok.
Michael: Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Charles: That's not the way it's gonna work.
Michael: Yes it is!
Charles: No, it is not.
Michael: No, it is not.
Charles: Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Michael: Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Charles: Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
Michael: Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
Charles: No, seriously.
Michael: No, seriously.
Charles: How old are you?
Michael: How old are you?
Pam: Oh no.
Pam: I can tell Michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do, the more infantile, the more upset he is. And he just skipped the Ace Ventura talking butt thing. He never skips it. This is bad.
Charles: Five years old?
Michael: Five years old?
Andy: Duuudes, stop.
Employees: [as Michael continues imitating Charles] Not a good idea, Michael. Michael, stop. Stop doing that. Stop it. You're going to get all of us in trouble.
Charles: I will walk away.
Michael: I'm gonna walk away.
Andy: Stop doing that!
Michael: I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
Pam: And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.
Michael: What is that smaller stripper holding?
Pam: Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.
Michael: Ok.
Charles: What exactly is the PPC?
Phyllis: Oh, that's the Party Planning Committee. They spend hours planning parties.
Charles: Excuse me, guys. What's going on in here?
Michael: Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
Charles: This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
Michael: Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
Jim: No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.
Charles: Whatcha got, Jim?...  What is a two-way petting zoo?
Jim: You pet the animals and they pet you back.
Michael: It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
Pam: It's really just a regular shaped cake.
Michael: But it's cool, and it's-
Charles: This isn't a good use of company time, Michael.
Michael: Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
Charles: Everyone, except for Michael, go back to your desks.
Michael: Yeah, why don't you do that?
Charles: [Dwight, Jim and Pam leave] Thank you very much.
Michael: Yeah, here we go. Ok.
Charles: Ok, Michael, I'm dissolving this committee.
Michael: What?
Charles: Yeah, I mean, come on. This is a work place. It isn't designed for your vanity.
Michael: Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
Charles: I don't know if I have hurt your feelings or you do not disagree with my methods, but it is over.
Michael: Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves]
Charles: [Jim knocks on door] Come in.
Jim: Hey.
Charles: Hey.
Jim: Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Charles: Number two?
Jim: Second-in-command to Michael.
Charles: Oh, I didn't know that position existed.
Jim: Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Charles: So you're the assistant to the regional manager?
Jim: Assistant regional manager, yeah.
Charles: Any responsibilities come with it?
Jim: No, not exactly.
Charles: So you keep this made up position? It's important to you?
Jim: Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.
Charles: Yeah, would you, uh?
Jim: Yep. [shuts door behind him]
Michael: Hello, Stephanie. Ok, where is he? [looks into empty office]
David: [coming out from bathroom] Michael.
Michael: [points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
David: How did you get here, Michael?
Michael: I drove.
David: Ok.
Michael: Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.
David: Michael. Listen-
Michael: Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
David: Well, I didn't know about the figs, specifically. . .
Michael: Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
David: That's not exactly-
Michael: Clearly that's what you wanted.
David: No.
Michael: Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
David: Yes.
Michael: I've put having a family on hold.
David: We didn't ask you to do that.
Michael: And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
Charles: Ok. Nice meeting everyone. I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Andy: Cool.
Dwight: Excellent.
Angela: It was very nice meeting you, Charles Miner.
Jim: See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!
Jim: And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.
Kelly: I could see our kids facing obstacles being half-Black and half-Indian, but it's so worth it, you guys.
Phyllis: It's just me here.
Kelly: I am going to get him to buy me a prime rib tonight.
Phyllis: I think he left.
Kelly: What?! Move! [pushes cameraman out of the way]
Angela: [Kelly runs to parking lot in the rain] Hello, Charles? Charles!
Kelly: Hey! Is that his scarf?
Angela: No! [Kelly chases Angela through parking lot]
Angela: [out of breath and wet] Charles and Kelly? Absolutely not. He is a sophisticated man. He does not need to go dumpster-diving for companionship, ok?
Michael: I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.
David: Yeah. You're right. Yes. I get it. I get it, Michael. Here's what I'm going to do-
Michael: Ok.
David: We will move some money around, and I will personally see to it that you have your party, you have your figs. I will be in attendance. It's gonna be great. How's that?
Michael: [gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.
David: What?
Michael: You have no idea how high I can fly.
Andy: I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.
Meredith: Ok, what do you think?
Oscar: Well, it's-
Andy: Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.
Creed: The real question here is who's this guy work for?
Oscar: Dunder Mifflin.
Creed: Ah, it's all starting to make sense now.
Michael: I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Should've peed before I left.
Kelly: Michael get to the good part.
Michael: Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.
Oscar: At least he is in the building.
Michael: No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
Everyone: [groans]
Pam: He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.
Pam: Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?
Michael: I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.'
Stanley: Did you tell him how sick of him you were?
Michael: Why would I do that?
Angela: Well, wouldn't it feel good to tell him that he was incompetent?
Kevin: That he's wasted 15 years of your life?
Meredith: Did you spit in his face?
Michael: You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
Oscar: I love a good quitting story. It makes me feel like I have control over my own life.  Gives me hope.  Maybe I will have one of own someday.  [laughs] But I dream... so...
Jim: [Michael has a 'sticky-hand' toy and snags a paper off Jim's desk and then laughs] About a week ago, Michael gave his 2-week notice. And, surprisingly there is a very big difference between Michael trying and Michael not trying.
Kevin: Michael is that scotch?
Michael: Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch. [in Oscar's ear] Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
Michael: [slightly drunk] What am I gonna do? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I gonna do a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  I gonna stay up all day.  Gonna sleep it up all night. I'm gonna give it a OHH! HEY! HO!  And I'm going to stop worrying about calories.
Stanley: Maybe you should go into your office, close the door, and make some calls about jobs?
Michael: I have a job.
Andy: For four more days.
Pam: Do you have any leads on a job?
Michael: Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.
Jim: You called any headhunters?
Michael: Any good headhunter knows I am available.
Dwight: Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Jim: Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Charles: Uh, I need you to go over this client list and indicate any wrong or false data.
Michael: You're 'I need you to' is my command.
Charles: Okay.
Andy: Hey Michael...
Michael: Hey.
Andy: Can I talk to you a minute?
Michael: You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world. [eats some spaghetti] Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
Andy: I just wanted to tell you that... Oh What?  [takes a present out from behind his back]  What's that?
Michael: Oh! Hey. What is this about?
Andy: Um, you know, cause your leaving and so, it's a farewell...
Michael: Oh.
Andy: I hope I get to work with you someday again.
Michael: Me too, me too. Is this wine?
Andy: Ah... busted. Yes
Michael: I already have wine.
Andy: Oh.
Isaac: [interviewee enters office] Hello.
Pam: Hi.
Isaac: Isaac Silby  here for the interview
Pam: Uh, yes.  Please have a seat. It'll be a few minutes.
Isaac: Thank you. [to Michael] You interviewing too?
Michael: Hmm?
Isaac: Interviewing?
Michael: For?
Isaac: Regional manager.
Michael: Yes I am.
Charles: For regional manager I've decided to go with an outside hire.  For obvious reasons.
Michael: Where you from?
Isaac: Philly.
Michael: That's a drive!
Isaac: Yeah, well this is one of the few places that's hiring.  It's uh, its brutal out there.
Michael: [sighs]
Kevin: Pam?
Pam: Hmm?
Kevin: When will the new copier be ready?
Pam: I'm working on it Kev.
Kevin: You said it would be ready by today.  And it is today.
Pam: It'll be ready soon.
Kevin: Soon could mean anything. Soon could be 3 weeks.
Pam: Is that what 'soon' means to you?
Kevin: Sometimes.
Pam: Then come back soon.
Pam: During the course of business, a copier goes though something called 'Normal wear and tear.'
Creed: [feeding coins into a vent] I think it's 75 cents.
Oscar: That's a lot.
Angela: [Bandit is chewing on wires] Bandit, No! No no no!
Kevin: [dumps coffee all over the copier glass] Oh!
Pam: Yesterday, they delivered the new one. But they didn't set it up. So my day just got a little more interesting. [holds up a huge manual]
Jim: [overhears loud monster noises] Its Monster dot com.  Singular.
Michael: Thank you. [groaning ceases]
Michael: You work in paper long enough, you get to know the players. [dials phone]
Phone: Hi, you've reached Prince Paper.  We are sad to inform you that after 40 years of serving the community we are no longer in business.  Thank you for your support. May God bless you. [girl's voice] Bye!
Michael: [sighs] What am I gong to do?  Uh... [chuckles].
Michael: PSST! PSST!
Jim: Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
Michael: Okay, oh okay, okay.  Close your eyes.
Jim: I would prefer not to.
Michael: Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
Jim: You're starting your own paper company?
Michael: yeah!
Jim: Why?
Michael: Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
Jim: Do you know the industry is in decline?
Michael: Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
Jim: Right.
Michael: Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
Jim: No, I did that before, it added nothing.
Michael: Close them.
Jim: Okay. [keeps eyes open]
Michael: Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
Jim: I am not gonna do this.
Michael: Obviously.
Jim: And you are not going to, either.
Michael: Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
Jim: Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
Michael: Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
Charles: Jim.
Jim: Hey.
Charles: what are you doing?
Jim: Nothing, just talking.
Charles: Okay, Michael handed in his 2-week notice, did you also hand in your 2-week?
Jim: I didn't... no.
Charles: Okay.  After you.
Michael: No I'm staying.
Charles: Okay.
Dwight: [examining the copier manual] Do you want me to translate the German instructions for you?
Pam: No, I'm sure they're pretty much the same as the English instructions.
Dwight: Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
Pam: That's a really... well fine,  Do the German instructions say what this is supposed to do?
Dwight: Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.
Pam: Hmm...
Dwight: My German is pre-industrial and mostly religious.
Michael: Pam, listen.  This order form.  Instead of saying 'Dunder Mifflin' at the top is there any way I could get it to say something else?
Pam: Like Michael Scott Paper Company?
Michael: You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
Pam: Hmm... yeah.  Listen Michael.  Have you really thought this through?  'Cause it's a pretty big risk.
Michael: This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
Pam: Yeah... you could give it up though right? And almost nobody would know.
Michael: Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients.  Half of them, at least. I can do it again.  I know the market, I know the price points.  I'm on it, don't worry.  So, how do I do that?
Pam: Well, um, you can scan it, and then you can upload the image, and then you can copy the new image.
Michael: Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
Pam: Yeah. Good.
Michael: Thank you very much.
Pam: Mmm-hmm
Kelly: So that is why I have to leave at 5: 00 on Tuesday, it's to pick up my little sisters from school.  We're really tight. We're like the Kardashians..
Charles: You know, you can run this stuff by Toby.
Kelly: Yeah I don't like talking... [knock on door]
Charles: Come in...
Angela: I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with anyone.  I just wanted to bring you the brochure on that accounting seminar that I was telling you about.  Earlier.
Kelly: Yep, we were in the middle of something so why don't you just...
Angela: Okay, um, actually you know it was so much fun last year. There was a Sunday-bar.  I mean I didn't have any, you know, to stay trim.
Charles: Did Michael just let anybody in his office?
Angela and Kelly: Yep! Yeah. He just loved having people, communicating all the time. He was like 'Come on in!'
Charles: I am aware of the effect I have on woman.
Kelly: So you should be heading back to your desk.
Angela: Okay.  Bye Charles.  Well you'll let me know.  Good bye.
Kelly: She's such a special person.  And she's turning 50 this year.
Michael: I'm starting my own paper company.
Andy: No way!?
Michael: Yeah.
Andy: In this climate?
Michael: Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Andy: Ehh... [in accent] well it's a very intriguing concept, isn't it?  Um... hmmm..[makes weird noises to stall, Dwight enters] Michael is starting his own paper company. What do you think about that?
Dwight: Your own paper company.
Michael: Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
Dwight: Right...
Michael: Potential, lots of potential. yes.
Dwight: What a courageous venture.
Michael: It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
Dwight: Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities...
Michael: That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
Dwight: Okay. So yeah.
Michael: So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
Dwight: You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Pam: Everyone, can I have your attention.  This is the moment you've all been waiting for. Right? [drum roll on copier]
Meredith: Little Ms. Thing wants attention.
Pam: Meredith...  [copier has an error] Oh... so uh... G-44.  It's not ready Kevin!
Pam: I'm at a crucial point where I have sunk 4 hours into that copier, and I am not going to let it beat me like that wireless router did.
Oscar: [bites his sandwich and notices there is a note in it]
Oscar: You put a note in my food?
Michael: I made it sterile.
Oscar: Just to say 'sterile' doesn't make it so.
Michael: I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
Oscar: Do you have a business plan?  A funding request? Market research, financials?
Michael: No, no no.
Oscar: You need those things.  Most new businesses, they don't make a profit till at least two years.  And then your margins will be razor thin. Best case scenario, you don't cut yourself a salary for at least 5 years.  Can you go 5 years without a salary, Michael?
Michael: Okay.
Oscar: Five years?
Michael: Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me.
Oscar: It's just not prudent Michael.
Michael: [from inside the restroom] Stanley?
Stanley: Can't you see I'm urinating?
Michael: Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
Stanley: No.
Michael: Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
Stanley: No.
Michael: Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
Stanley: No I didn't.
Michael: You know what.  I had a great time at prom.  And no one said 'Yes' to that either.
Pam: How's it working?
Phyllis: Um, let's see... it's fine.
Pam: Good.
Pam: I did it. I learned everything about this machine.  I know all the buttons, even the inside ones.   I know all the error messages.  I could do a bound book, in plastic with offset colors.  Which feels...
Charles: Hey Hank, You ready?
Hank: Yeah.
Charles: Okay, Michael?
Michael: Hmm?
Charles: I can't pretend I haven't seen that.  So I am going e to ask you to stand up, walk  out. And you can't take anything.
Michael: Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...
Charles: not if you're starting your own paper company, Michael. Hank...
Hank: Okay Michael.
Michael: Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
Hank: Come on man, let's, let's go.
Kevin: I always thought Michael got a bad rap. He's a good guy.  And he's super funny.  Yeah, maybe I should tell him before he goes.  He's all the way over there.
Michael: [to everyone] Well here we are... I would just like to...
Charles: No, no no no.  You're done, Michael.
Michael: [yelling from Parking lot] Alright then everybody, I'm outta here!
Andy: [from behind the upstairs window] What is he doing? It looks like he's saying something.
Kevin: I think he's singing.
Oscar: I can't believe this is really happening.
Michael: ... and I feel free!
Oscar: And just like that.  As mysteriously as he arrived, he was gone. [Michael sneaks back in the parking lot, and into a back door of the building]
Andy: The whole office feels darker, you know?  It's just a sad dark day.
Phyllis: Andy He's gone.
Andy: I know.
Phyllis: You don't have to kiss his ass anymore.
Toby: Michael is like a movie on a plane.  You know, it's not great, but it's something to watch.  And when it's over you're like... how much time is left on this flight? Now what?
Pam: [Michael is Army crawling around the office] Michael?
Michael: Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
Angela: These are for employees only.
Michael: Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
Kevin: Michael, why is it that you asked everyone except me, Angela, Creed, and Meredith?
Michael: I was going to, I wanted to.  But I had to start somewhere.
Kevin: But you didn't want to start with us?
Michael: No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
Jim: I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Michael: So which way are you leaning?
Jim: Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.
Michael: Thanks Jim.
Charles: Hey, did anyone see the client list that Michael was supposed to be working on.
Dwight: No.
Charles: Okay, let me know if you find it.
Michael: Okay, Okay, we don't have much time.  Just act normal.  Don't look at me people. Stop.  Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me.  Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  You're older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?  [Pam is thinking hard] Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot.  Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me.  Come on Phyllis.  Here we go, here we go!
Charles: Michael get up!
Michael: Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!
Charles: Michael, what are you doing?
Michael: I think maybe Hank should be here.
Charles: Hank?  No, I don't need Hank Michael.
Michael: You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose. [Charles steps towards Michael] Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.
Pam: Oh no.
Jim: What?
Pam: I'm going with him.
Jim: What? Pam!
Pam: I'm going.
Jim: Pam! You can't be serious.
Pam: Michael, wait!  I'm coming with you.
Michael: You are?
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: Okay.  It's going to be great.
Pam: Great. Uh, except, I don't want to be a receptionist anymore.
Michael: Right... Executive assistant.
Pam: Salesman.
Michael: Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
Jim: Still no.
Michael: Well, okay, lets go.
Pam: Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs so...
Michael: Are people watching?
Pam: Probably.
Jim: Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you...
Michael: Jim Jim Jim... we're having a company meeting here.
Jim: I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
Pam: Okay, see you later.
Michael: Bye.
Charles: So, we had a personnel change today.  Shouldn't effect our day to day.  But, until we get a new receptionist I want Kevin on the phones.
Kevin: Phones?
Charles: Also, there has been too much wasted time.  So Stanley.
Stanley: [holding a crossword puzzle] Yes.
Charles: Yeah, I want you to be on top of that okay?  I want you to be my productivity czar. Okay, good.  Uh, okay that it on my list. So uh, you know, no excuses guys. Lets get going okay? [everyone leaves except Kevin and Stanley, who are sitting stunned in their chairs]
Pam: [on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.
Dwight: Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
Jim: [on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Dwight: No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
Pam: There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.
Dwight: [on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
Dwight: I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.
Pam: Kevin, you're such a gourmand.
Kevin: I cooked my way through Julia Childs' cookbook, and now, I'm halfway through the Twilight cookbook.  Last night, I had Edward's corn flake chicken.
Pam: Hmm.
Kevin: Pregnant Pam and I, we get hungry at the same times, so we've been eating together a lot.  Not all meals.  Just second breakfast, lunch, second lunch, and first dinner.
Kevin: I thought that maybe we should do something special for early dinner.  One last ultra feast.
Pam: Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?
Kevin: I think it should be a surprise.
Meredith: [After Pam has a contraction]  Oh, getting there, huh?
Pam: No, no.  I still have time.
Pam: I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.
Jim: Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Pam: If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.
Jim: Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
Pam: I cannot wait for that joke to be over.
Pam: Ooh.
Michael: Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
Jim: Michael.
Michael: Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Jim: Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
Michael: Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Pam: You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
Michael: Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Jim: Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Michael: Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Pam: Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.
Erin: Ooh, spooky.  But why?
Jim: Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Pam: Everything's fine.  We have plenty of time.
Nick: Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam.  Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.
Michael: Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
Angela: [as Nick looks over at her]  What are you looking at?
Dwight: Ha, nerd.
Kelly: Did you know that labor can last weeks?  Then they take your insides out and they just plop them on a table, and sometimes epidurals don't work, and you can poop yourself.
Dwight: [with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.
Angela: Excuse me?
Dwight: I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.
Jim: [after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.
Pam: Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.
Jim: Are you serious?  Pam.
Pam: No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.
Jim: I...  Pam, please.
Pam: I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.
Andy: Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.
Pam: Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.
Jim: Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
Pam: Five minutes apart.
Jim: So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.
Pam: Okay, stop watching me.
Jim: Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Jim: Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Pam: Not until midnight.
Andy: Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.
Erin: I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr.
Andy: My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.
Jim: You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Michael: No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
Jim: [as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
Pam: Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
Michael: Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!
Michael: Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]
Michael: The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.
Andy: Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
Michael: I will allow that.
Andy: Yes!  Can anyone do those?
Stanley: I'm going to go look at the Internet.
Jim: [as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
Pam: Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.
Michael: Okay.
Kelly: Oh my God, Pam, you are a woman warrior.
Pam: Oh, thanks, Kelly.
Michael: Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
Pam: Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.
Michael: Yes, Phyl?
Phyllis: I can put on lipstick the way Molly Ringwald does in The Breakfast Club.
Michael: [ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
Andy: I can do the evolution of dance-dance.
Michael: [as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
Andy: Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.
Ryan: [reading from a book as Kelly admires]  'You let me in your bed.  But now, I sleep alone.  Trapped with the forgotten in my detritus home.'
Erin: [naming race horses]  Affirmed.  Seattle Slew.  Secretariat.  Citation.  Assault.  Count Fleet.  Rollaway.  War Admiral.  Omaha.  Gallant Fox...  And...  I know this.  Uh...  The jockey was Johnny Loftus.  Sired by Star Shoot.
Angela: Good afternoon.
Dwight: Have a seat.
Angela: What is this?
Dwight: Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.
Angela: Of course.
Dwight: It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.
Angela: You know I was thinking...
Dwight: Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?
Angela: Agreed.
Michael: [as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.
Kevin: For the love of God, Pam, do it for ultra feast!
Jim: Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Pam: Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.
Michael: Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.
Jim: Alright.
Michael: Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
Erin: Um, stimulate the nipples.
Michael: Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
Kevin: Her shirt is touching them.  Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt.
Meredith: I have a shirt like that in my car.
Michael: Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
Erin: Okay, uh, the second one is walk around.  We're already doing the opposite of that.  Perfect.  Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.
Michael: Okay, the opposite of that?
Kevin: Stick spicy food up her butt.
Jim: Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Pam: Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.
Jim: Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
Pam: Why don't you go do some work?
Jim: Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Pam: I know, you don't like to be frazzled.
Jim: No, I don't.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
Michael: Ooh, someone's freakin'.
Andy: A little frazzled.
Michael: I think he is.
Jim: I know Pam better than anyone in this office, and obviously she's gone crazy, but everybody wants to say that I'm crazy.  But I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  I'm not crazy, she's crazy.  [reading from various books]  Five to seven minutes.  Five to seven minutes.  Six minutes.  Different, but not really.  Five to seven minutes.
Dwight: Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.
Angela: Jedediah.
Dwight: Jonas.
Angela: Jedediah.
Dwight: Warf.
Angela: No Star Trek names.
Dwight: Okay.  Fine.
Angela: What if it's a girl?
Dwight: Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.
Angela: Hey.  Uh-uh.  I cannot control that.  You can't put that in here.
Dwight: Yes you can.
Angela: No.
Dwight: It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.
Angela: Absolutely not.
Jim: [Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.
Pam: Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.
Jim: Ah, you know me too well.
Pam: Okay, Jim.
Jim: Yeah?  ...  Oh.
Pam: Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?
Jim: Did you say 'she?'
Pam: I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.
Jim: Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
Pam: Mm-hmm.
Jim: Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Pam: I know.
Jim: Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
Pam: Good.
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Alright...  Hey, did you change?
Pam: Oh, yeah, my water broke.
Jim: Oh.  Oh...
Pam: [enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.
Michael: Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it's time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
Phyllis: No, it's 4:35.
Michael: 4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
Pam: No, not yet, Michael.
Michael: We can do...
Pam: Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?
Michael: Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
Oscar: That's fancy feast.  Ultra feast is something they made up so they can pig out together in the name of ceremony.
Michael: What is October feast?
Pam: There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.
Kevin: Our ultra feast menu's theme:  Hollywood.  We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels.  I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I...  Are you okay?
Pam: Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.
Michael: Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
Jim: Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Michael: That's right, let's do this.
Jim: Let's give it a shot.
Pam: Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.
Jim: Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
Pam: They're not that bad still, babe.
Jim: Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
Pam: No, it's passing, it's fine.  It's okay.
Jim: Come on, Michael says we should go now.
Michael: Let's go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
Pam: No, it's passing, it's fine.
Jim: Pam.
Pam: Ah, no, it passed.  It's good.
Jim: You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Pam: Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.
Jim: Hey, are you kidding me?
Michael: Are you kidding?
Jim: If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Michael: You can do this.  You can do this.
Jim: Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
Michael: I'm scared, too.
Kevin: I'm petrified.
Jim: The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: A really awesome baby.
Michael: We're going to have a baby.
Jim: So let's have it at the hospital.
Michael: Let's do that.
Jim: How are we doing on contractions?
Michael: Two minutes apart.
Jim: Two minutes...
Pam: Oh, God.  Oh, no.
Jim: Michael, I told you.
Michael: It's okay.
Jim: No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Pam: Jim, we waited too long!
Michael: I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
Jim: We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
Michael: We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
Pam: I don't want to have my baby here.
Michael: You're not going to.  You know where you're going?
Pam: The hospital.
Michael: Yes, you are.  And you know what you're going to have?
Pam: A baby.
Michael: Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
Michael: I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!
Dwight: No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.
Jim: Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
Michael: No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
Jim: Alright, I have my wallet.
Michael: Yes.
Jim: Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Michael: Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?
Erin: There's nothing in it.
Michael: You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
Oscar: The hospital provides dictionaries, bring a thesaurus!
Dwight: Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!
Pam: Dwight, get away!
Michael: No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
Erin: I didn't know we had a tape measure.
Dwight: [as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.
Jim: Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.
Dwight, Jim and Michael: Here we go!
Phyllis: Good luck!
Nick: Good luck, Pam!
Michael: Thank you!  Wish me luck!
Creed: Have fun!  [sigh]
Meredith: Hey, it's 5:00!
Michael: [entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!
Stanley: Hold it!
Michael: Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We're going now!
Toby: Oh, one more!
Michael: No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
Michael: Dwight, what is the traffic like?
Dwight: Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!
Michael: Alright.
Dwight: Let's go!
Michael: Geesh, Dwight!
Dwight: [as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!
Michael: What!?
Dwight: This is where I saw that deer last week.
Michael: Where?
Dwight: Right over by that fence.
Michael: By the bushes?
Jim: Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Michael: Okay, go, go, go, go!
Dwight: Let's go!
Dwight: I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.
Jim: Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.
Michael: Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
Pam: Michael!
Michael: Yeah?
Pam: Stop texting, put your phone away!  Come on.
Jim: Michael, come on!
Michael: I'm texting about you, okay!?
Dwight: Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?
Policeman: Pull over!
Dwight: Are you kidding me?
Policeman: Pull over!  [Dwight begins throwing various weapons out of the window]  You're not allowed to impersonate a police officer!  Don't make this difficult, Dwight!
Pam: Wait, wait.  My iPod's not in here!
Jim: Okay.
Pam: It has the birth song on it!
Jim: Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
Pam: Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.
Jim: Okay, so what do you want to do?
Pam: I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!
Jim: Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Michael: Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?
Dwight: Dwight Schrute.
Michael: Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
Dwight: Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.
Michael: Okay.
Pam: Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...
Dwight: I don't need a key.
Pam: Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a key, just listen it's under the...
Dwight: No, no, don't, don't tell me.  Alalalalalalalalalala lalalalalala alalalalalalalala.
Pam: Dwight just listen!  It's underneath...  [Dwight hangs up as the policeman hands him a ticket]
Michael: Okay.
Jim: Wait, you alright?
Pam: Yes.
Michael: Do you have everything, guys?
Jim: Michael, just go park the car.
Michael: Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]
Hospital employee: Sir!  You can't park here!
Michael: Dunder-Mifflin.  It's okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.
Jim: Pam's doing great.  Uh, she's ten inches dilated now.  Uh, sorry, meters.  Centimeters.  And she's also fully faced.  Which I don't know what that is, uh, but no baby yet.  It's only been six, uh, nineteen hours, and uh, I just went out for some ice chips because I might have passed out a little bit, but these are very refreshing, very good.
Nurse: Daddy?  She's ready to push.
Jim: Okay.
Michael: Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
Jim: [as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.
Doctor: Not yet.
Jim: No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
Nurse: Why don't you get more ice chips?
Pam: No, Jim, stay!
Doctor: Okay.  Really push this time, Pam.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: [looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I'm going to go wash my eyes.
Michael: That kid's going to have a lot of hair.
Andy: Hey, have you guys seen her?
Meredith: She hasn't popped yet.
Andy: What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.
Andy: I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.
Phyllis: This is ridiculous.  We just can't wait here.
Michael: I think it's going to be any minute now.
Phyllis: But you don't know that.  I mean, we could be here another half an hour.
Michael: Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
Phyllis: I have an ice cream cake in the car.
Michael: Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
Michael: [Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...
Pam: This is happening!
Michael: You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
Jim: Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
Pam: Oh, my God.
Michael: [smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?
Doctor: Sir!  Sir, you can't smoke that in here.  Put it, put it out.
Michael: Okay.  You can't smoke anywhere these days.
Pam: [with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?
Jim: No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
Pam: Okay.
Michael: Guys, guys!
Jim: Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Michael: Eleven pounds...
Jim: She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Everyone: Yeah!
Michael: Thank you!  Thank you!
Oscar: Congratulations.  That's great.
(Pam's mom) Heleen: Hi there.
Jim: Hey, grandma's back.
Helene: Well, it was an adventure and a half trying to find the cafeteria, but I have returned with the coffee.
Jim: Great.
Pam: Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.
Helene: Ooh, somebody has a full diaper.
Jim: Oh.  Let me get it.
Jim: I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.
Michael: Where's the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.
Helene: Hello, Michael.
Michael: Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
Helene: I'm, uh...  You know I think, uh, I think it's time for me to go.
Pam: Okay.
Helene: Love you.
Michael: Love you, as a friend.
Pam: Love you, mom.
Michael: Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
Pam: Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.
Michael: Alright.
Pam: Again, no pants.
Michael: Oh, okay.
Jim: Ready?
Michael: Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
Jim: It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
Dwight: Yesterday, I was dispatched to Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.  I searched everywhere, but I didn't find it.  What I did find, was mold, and lots of it.  So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].
Michael: There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
Andy: This man has a gift!
Michael: Who else here is single?
Kelly: I'm not single.  I have a man. [she grasps Ryan's arm as Ryan has his hand raised to say he's single]
Michael: I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
Stanley: Why do you find someone for yourself instead of meddling in our affairs?
Michael: Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
Ryan: Ha ha, plus size models, maybe.
Michael: Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.
Meredith: You know it.  I am never getting married.
Meredith: Like Clooney.
Michael: Andrew, what about you?
Andy: Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.
Andy: Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.
Michael: Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.
Pam: Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?
Jim: We were just kids.  What did we know?
Nurse: How we doing?
Jim: Great.
Pam: Good.
Nurse: Would you like me to take her to the nursery for the night?
Pam: Doesn't she sleep here?
Nurse: She can.  But a lot of parents choose to have the baby spend the first night in the nursery to get some rest.  You've been through a lot.
Jim: I think we'll be okay.
Nurse: Okay, great.
Pam: [as the baby yawns]  Oh, big yawn.
Jim: Ready?  One, two, three...
Pam: One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.
Jim: I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
Pam: She's not gonna...  Just...
Jim: I got it.  Alright.
Pam: Go.
Jim: Nurse!
Jim: How you doing?
Pam: I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.
Jim: Really?
Pam: Doesn't feel right.
Jim: Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
Pam: How does one do that?
Jim: Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
Pam: Do you want to try it, Jim?
Jim: I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
Nurse: Somebody buzzed?
Jim: Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
Pam: I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.
Nurse: Well, maybe we should take a break for a little while.  I can take her to the nursery and then bring her back and try again a little bit later.
Pam: Even if she's not getting anything?
Nurse: Yeah, she'll be fine.  I can always give her a bottle since we're in the nursery.
Pam: No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.
Nurse: Oh, good.  You know everything.
Pam: She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.
Nurse: Well, I'll bring her back in a little while and we can try again, okay?
Jim: Alright.
Nurse: Alright.
Jim: It's going to be alright.
Pam: Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.
Jim: Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
Erin: [in Michael's office]  You wanted to see me?
Michael: What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
Erin: Oh, boy!  ...  What's that sound?
Kevin: [as he appears from behind the door]  Ta-da!
Michael: I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
Kevin: Yes!
Erin: I don't know what to say.
Kevin: Oh, say nothing.  You will learn to love me.
Michael: Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth.  Why don't you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
Kevin: Erin, would you have lunch with me?
Erin: Okay.
Michael: Good!
Kevin: Yes!
Erin: Michael, could I talk to you privately?
Michael: Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
Kevin: Bye.
Michael: Bye.
Erin: I'm so sorry if I gave you the impression I'm into Kevin, but I'm not.  I like Andy.
Michael: Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
Erin: I'm sure he'll be fine.
Michael: I'm not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
Erin: Really?
Michael: No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.
Erin: I don't want anyone to die.
Michael: Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
Kevin: Hi.
Erin: Hi.
Kevin: She touched my shoulder.
Nurse: Hey, guys.  We're short on rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.
Jim: Oh, hi.
Kathy: Hi.
Dale: Hi, so sorry.
Jim: Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Pam: I know.
Jim: You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
Erin: Did you grow up around here?
Kevin: No.
Erin: So, you must have grown up around somewhere else?
Kevin: Yes.
Andy: Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.
Hospital employee: Uh, hi, Pam Halpert?
Pam: Yes?
Hospital employee: Hi.  I'm Clark.  Josie said you might benefit from a lactation consultant.
Pam: Um, yeah, that would be great.
Jim: Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?
Clark: Actually, uh, I'm the consultant.  Got milk?  Ha ha.  Alright, let's see what we're working with.
Pam: So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...
Clark: I'll get that for you.
Pam: Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.
Clark: Okay.  Let me feel here.
Pam: Okay.
Clark: Yeah, it's quite full.  Why don't you put your hand on top of my hand.
Pam: Okay.
Clark: When you're feeding, you want to press in like this, make your hand in a C.  Uh, does that hurt?
Pam: No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.
Clark: Okay.
Jim: Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
Pam: No.  It just feels like pressure.
Clark: Okay, well.  Feel how I'm flicking the nipple?  Like that?
Jim: Yup.
Clark: Stimulate it.
Jim: Yeah.
Clark: Alright, so you just want to do that, and that will, uh...
Jim: Perfect.
Clark: And you can just...  The baby should grab on to that.
Jim: I think she will.
Pam: Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...
Jim: We'll figure it out.
Clark: It doesn't...  Why don't you bring your baby over here...  She's beautiful.
Pam: Okay.  Aw, thank you.
Clark: Yes, congratulations.
Jim: Thank you.
Clark: Well, you're doing a good job.  Just stay relaxed, and I'll come back in a bit to check on you.  Okay?
Pam: Okay.
Jim: Please do.
Pam: Oh, shoot.
Jim: What?
Pam: Shoot, she fell off.
Jim: Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
Pam: Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?
Jim: No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Pam: Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.
Jim: Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
Dwight: [on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?
Angela: Have you had a chance to look over the revisions on the contract I've prepared for you?
Dwight: Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Angela: I look forward to it.
Dwight: Very well.
Angela: Goodbye.
Pam: [trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.
Jim: Hmm?
Pam: Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.
Jim: Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam]
Pam: I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.
Jim: That's amazing.
Pam: Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'
Jim: That's awesome.
Pam: Aw, we're doing it.
Jim: that's great.
Pam: We're really parents now.
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Michael: Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.
Erin: Hey.
Kevin: Hi.
Erin: I have really enjoyed our time together.
Kevin: Yeah, me too.
Erin: I want to continue working on our friendship.
Kevin: Really, really fun.
Erin: Because I think our friendship could be a really cool thing.
Kevin: Yeah, me too.
Erin: And, you're my friend.
Kevin: Yeah.
Erin: And I hope that I'm your friend...  And, maybe...
Kevin: Yeah.
Michael: Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Kevin: You said she liked me.
Michael: Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
Kevin: I've dumped better than Erin.
Michael: No.
Kevin: Lynn was way hotter than Erin, Michael.
Michael: Lynn was as hot as Erin.
Kevin: Yeah, Michael, but you dated Holly and Jan, and they were so much hotter than you.
Michael: This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Andy: [he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.
Michael: Kev...  Nice.  Going.
Erin: Well...
Isabelle: Knock knock.
Pam: Oh, hey, Isabelle.
Jim: Hey.
Isabelle: Hey.  Pam, she's gorgeous.  Can I hold her?
Pam: Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!
Jim: What?
Pam: Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.
Jim: Okay, okay.
Pam: Oh, my gosh.
Kathy: [waking up]  Oh,has she been fussing long?
Pam: No, not at all.
Jim: Perfect.
Kathy: I was out like a light...  Oh, she's not hungry...
Nurse: How's it going?
Pam: Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...
Jim: Ha ha ha.
Nurse: Bottles are fine.  A lot of babies grow up using bottles.  So are you excited to bring your baby home?
Jim: We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Nurse: Yeah, you can.  It's 2:35.
Jim: Half hour.
Nurse: Twenty five minutes.  And you're all set with the car seat?
Jim: Yes, car seat's right there.
Nurse: That bottom part needs to go in the car.
Jim: Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Nurse: Ha ha, be back in twenty five minutes.
Jim: Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
Isabelle: [entering the Halpert house]  Hello?  Dwight?  What, what are you doing here?
Dwight: Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...
Isabelle: Wow, ha.  New cabinets.
Dwight: Yup.
Isabelle: All I did was bring macaroni and cheese...  Where's the fridge?
Dwight: Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.
Isabelle: Oh...  Well, I'll let you get back to it.
Dwight: Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.
Isabelle: Well, adults are supposed to go to the dentist, too.
Dwight: Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
Isabelle: Yeah...
Dwight: Alright.  I'll call you, kid.
Isabelle: Do that.
Jim: Are you really sure we should be leaving?
Hospital employee: Yeah.
Jim: But you hear the baby crying, right?
Hospital employee: Mm-hmm...  Where's your car?
Jim: Uh, it's in the lot.
Hospital employee: Oh, a lot of fathers bring their car around.
Jim: Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Pam: Okay, please hurry.
Andy: Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.
Erin: Okay, good.
Andy: The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.
Erin: It's busy.  Why don't I keep trying, and then I'll give you the confirmation in a bit?
Andy: Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.
Erin: [tearing up]  You can't talk to me like that.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I've been having a tough day today.
Andy: Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.
Erin: You read the fax.
Andy: I'm...  I'm asking you out.
Erin: Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Let me just fax this, and I'll check my planner.
Andy: So, it's a date.
Erin: Yes.  Do you have a day in mind?
Andy: Yeah, what day?  What day?
Erin: Everyday is fine.  Or...
Andy: Well, that, what's that one?
Erin: Thursday?
Andy: Okay.  Let's do it.
Erin: Okay.
Hospital employee: Would you like me to help you up out of the chair?
Pam: Oh, yeah, sorry.
Hospital employee: Yeah, we just got a lot of discharges today.
Pam: Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.
Jim: Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
Pam: Hi.  We did it.
Jim: You used my move, didn't you?
Pam: I used a variation of your move.
Michael: [smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think I'm going to be sick...
Dwight: Two forms of ID, please.
Angela: And now you, two forms of ID, please...  Alright, all is in order.  I just need your signature...  What is it?
Dwight: Nothing.
Angela: Alright.  How would you like to celebrate?
Dwight: Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.
Michael: Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! [Grabs and pours Kevin-esque scoop of M&Ms into his coat pocket] Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.
Kelly: I don't want to bring my friends, why can't it just be the two of us?
Ryan: Because it's St. Patrick's Day, people go out in groups.
Kelly: Well why don't you invite your friends?
Ryan: Why are you being so weird about this?
Meredith: Stop fighting. Just on St Patrick's Day, okay? Just one perfect day a year. No hassles, no problems, no kids.
Ryan: Why no kids?
Kelly: Yeah, where are your kids?
Meredith: Nope. Nuh -uh. Not today!
Michael: It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.
Erin: Welcome back, 'Dad!'
Jim: Oh, thank you!
Phyllis: Hey!
Stanley: Hey!
Andy: Welcome back Tuna!
Jim: Hey... [reveal Dwight's Mega-Desk]
Dwight: Very good. Okay. Will get back to you right away on that, thanks.
Jim: What do we got here?
Dwight: Mega-Desk.
Jim: Of course.
Dwight: Command central.
Jim: Hm hm.
Dwight: Surveillance, gaming- and business.
Jim: Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...
Dwight: Okay. Come on! Jim!
Dwight: Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.
Jo: Oh, I love this, so much fun! There's such team spirit in this room! 'Morning Darling!
Jim: Morning!
Jo: Well, this is my last day at the Scranton branch for a while. But I'm leaving it in the very capable hands of some of the loveliest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. Oh I'm gonna miss this place. And the snow! Hoo, my dogs love peeing in that snow! Makes me think they're onto something.
Jo: Oh good morning sweetheart.
Michael: Morning, honey-pile.
Jo: I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
Michael: It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
Jo: [pulls out glass cube with coal.] Is that a lump of coal?
Michael: Yes it is!
Jo: Have I been that naughty?
Michael: No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
Jo: Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.
Michael: Mm, that sounds great, actually.
Jo: Well, if you ever get down in my neck of the woods, you got a place to stay.
Michael: When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!
Andy: Erin go braugh!
Erin: Andy go braugh to you!  Nice kilt!
Andy: Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.
Andy: Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.
Jim: No. [re-enters bullpen from kitchen.]
Dwight: Great.
Jim: No.
Dwight: Thank you. [hangs up phone]
Jim: No-no-no-no-no.
Dwight: Oh come on. Come on. Five more minutes? Five more minutes of Mega-Desk? Please?
Jim: [swats over various photos and knickknacks, points at paperwork] Is this yours or mine?
Dwight: They say that no man is an island. False! I am an island and this island is volcanic. And it is about to erupt. With the molten hot lava of strategy!
Jim: Good Lord! [Photo of Cece on Jim's desktop] I can't believe I'm missing this.
Pam: It's kind of like that lip thing she did last night, like a half snarl, half smile? I get the sense that she's very ironic.
Jim: Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone]
Dwight: Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?
Jim: It is. Big time.
Dwight: Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.
Jim: Pretty amazing.
Dwight: What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.
Jim: Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Dwight: I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
Jim: Is that what happened to you?
Dwight: I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
Jim: That's a common mistake.
Dwight: Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
Angela: Hey! [Erin sneezing at desk] Are you sick?
Erin: Oh, no I'm fine, I just have a little indigestion.
Angela: In your nose?
Erin: Yes.  [Angela returns to desk and puts embroidered breathing mask on]
Erin: I'm a little sick but I don't want to miss my date with Andy. I'll get better. Whenever I'm sick it goes away within a few hours. Except once, when I was in the hospital from age three to six.
Jo: Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.
Michael: That is a great idea JB.
Jo: Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist.
Kevin: Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap.
Jo: You know it doesn't have to be an invention.
Oscar: I have a question.
Michael: Oscar, homosexual accountant.
Oscar: In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee?
Jo: I am so proud of Sabre's 'Print In All Colors' initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply. [Kelly applauds]  Daryl?
Michael: Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
Jo: Okay hush now.
Michael: Okay.
Daryl: The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in.
Jo: But you wouldn't need more trucks?
Daryl: Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs.
Jo: Oh look at you.
Michael: Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
Jo: [Looks over his proposal] I like this Daryl. I like this a lot. Maybe you should be doing your sketching upstairs. Would you like an office up here?
Daryl: Are you serious?
Jo: Yeah. Take Jim's old office.
Gabe: Um. I set my stuff up in there. So...  just give me a few minutes to clean that out for you.
Jo: Yeah, I want to hear more from you.
Daryl: Absolutely.
Jo: All right.
Daryl: Thank you.
Jo: Okay. Any questions? Anything on anybody's mind? I'm leaving tonight, this is your last chance for a while!
Michael: Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
Jo: Yes, well okay. Florida ain't that far away.
Michael: Well, I am heading down there.
Jo: Well, anytime now.
Michael: How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket]
Jo: Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket?
Michael: I did!
Jo: Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?
Michael: You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
Jo: Enough!
Michael: All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
Michael: Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.
Daryl: [singing] Moving on up, to the East Side, to the deluxe apartment in the sky...
Michael: Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.
Jo: No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
Michael: No is not an option.
Jo: Yes it is.
Michael: All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
Jo: How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
Michael: [laughs] I'll be over there.
Jim: And I'm actually pleased to be able to offer you printer cartridges and toner now.
Dwight: [Whispers] Oh Jim, Jim! Sorry to bother you.
Jim: What?
Dwight: My headphones are broken.
Jim: Right.
Dwight: Can I listen to my music at a low volume?
Jim: Yeah that's great. Great.
Dwight: Okay? [Unplugs cord, sings] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-'
Jim: [Overlapping] When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
D: - and the man in the moon. When you coming home Dad? I don't know when-'
Jim: [Whispers] Please stop that!
Dwight: -But we'll be together then-'
Jim: Can you grow up?
Dwight: -Dad, you know we'll have a good time then.'
Jim: [Turns off Dwight's music] Whether it's this time or next time.
Andy: [Vocalizes and continues song] 'The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon'
Jim: [On business call] Yeah.
Andy and Dwight: [Singing, Dwight supplies beats] 'Little boy blue and the man in the moon.'
Jim: No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--
Andy and Dwight: When you coming home Dad?
Jim: You know, can I call you back?
Andy and Dwight: I don't know when-'
Jim: That would be great, thank you.
Andy and Dwight: But we'll get together then, we're gonna have a good time-'
Jim: [On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.
Jim: I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.
Erin: This fax came for you. [Coughs]
Jo: Oh no no no!  Are you feeling ill?
Erin: Uh...
Jo: Oh no honey, if you got a bug, I want you to go on home. I can't have you getting Callie and Jo Jr. sick. These dogs have got to be in a commercial with Dwight Howard next week.
Erin: Oh! No. I feel like I could lift a car.
Jo: Yeah, but you sound like death, girl. Now why don't you go on home and take care of yourself and get in bed. And shred that and have them send me a clean fax, okay?
Erin: Well... [Jo closes door on her]
Andy: She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?
Jo: Yes?
Andy: I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint]
Jo: Oh! You're sick! [Andy coughs] Dangit! That's exactly why I sent that receptionist home.
Andy: No, no, no, no, no.
Jo: Get everybody sick in the office.
Andy: I have some good ideas...
Jo: We don't need any heroes here honey. It's time for you to get on home now.
Andy: You sure?
Jo: You'll probably feel better once you get some pants on. Come on.
Michael: Very nice.
Daryl: Not bad, huh?
Michael: A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
Daryl: I impressed her with my good ideas.
Michael: Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
Daryl: I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
Michael: How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
Daryl: Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.
Michael: Okay. All right.
Jo: Hey there.
Michael: Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
Jo: Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time.
Michael: Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
Jo: Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work...
Michael: Right. What?
Jo: Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.
Michael: Mm. mm. Oh well.
Jo: Anything else I can help you with?
Michael: No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
Kevin: Just because Jo has no life, does not mean that the rest of us don't have lives. Oscar has a life. I think Ryan has a life. This is outrageous.
Michael: Hey Pack-man.
Todd Packer: Hey what's up, Butt-plug?
Michael: How you doing stud? You already there?
Todd Packer: Dude, I've been here since three! I've boot and rallied twice.
Michael: How's the lady situation?
Todd Packer: Fat and ugly. You might actually have a chance.
Michael: Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
Todd Packer: Oh here's what you do. Hike up your skirt and pull out your tampon, borrow some balls and come meet me!
Michael: Yeah. Maybe next year.
Todd Packer: Maybe next 'queer.' Hey ladies, who wants some bangers and mash?
Erin: [Opens door, surprised] Oh! Andy!
Andy: Hi!
Erin: I'm in my jammy-jams!
Andy: That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!
Erin: Oh, thanks. Come in!
Meredith: Hey! Me and Creed are in. Are you guys in?
Kevin: Oh I'm in.
Oscar: I'm in.
Meredith: All right. [The four of them get out of chairs to run out, Jo exits her office. They retreat.]
Jo: Oh, you don't become the most powerful woman in Tallahassee by slacking off. [Scoffs] You do it by working hard. Or marrying rich. I did both!
Dwight: Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]
Dwight: Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...
Jo: Hello?
Jim: Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Jo: Well sure. You know, you go ahead and push some printers.
Jim: You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Jo: Okay.
Jim: Okay.
Jo: Sorry Sugar. What'd you want?
Dwight: Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.
Jo: Thank you.
Jim: [pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.
Daryl: Hey! What are you fellas doing up here?
Warehouse guy 1: We're here to bust you out!
Daryl: I wish, but uh-
Warehouse guy 1: Dude! Your shirt tucked in?
Daryl: Oh. Yeah, um, I must have did that when I was in the bathroom.  All right then, uh, let me get to it.
Warehouse guy 1: All right.
Warehouse guy 2: See you later.
Erin: Your hand's cold.
Andy: It is? I'm sorry.
Erin: Yeah, have some more blanket.
Andy: Okay, thanks.
Reid: What's up?
Andy: Whoa!
Erin: You're awake. Andy, this is my brother, Reid.
Andy: I didn't know you had a brother.
Erin: He's my foster brother.
Andy: Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]
Reid: Cold hands. [Takes spot next to Erin on love seat]
Andy: Are we rotating seats, or?
Reid: Oh yeah, you're the guest. Take the easy chair, best seat in the house. Plus, you don't have to sit next to this big dork and her smelly feet.
Erin: Hey! My feet aren't smelly, they smell like roses. Smell them! [puts her feet in his face]
Reid: Ooh! [Erin giggles]
Andy: So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?
Erin: None. We were in the same house from ages ten to twelve. And then from fifteen to eighteen.
Andy: All right. Formative years. [She laughs]
Reid: Nice skirt.
Andy: Yeah, it's a kilt.
Night cleaning crew: Oh! Sorry! Sorry, sorry. [They retreat. Pan around office still full with staff.]
Angela: Yes, I'm anxious to get off work. But let me be clear. It's not to celebrate St Patrick's Day. It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.
Jo: Overnight all my damn bags home. I'm carrying nothing but my Sable gloves.  I've had it with Homeland Security. And I want you to put all those tracking numbers in my Blackberry.
Michael: How late do we have to work tonight?
Gabe: You never know with Jo. Sometimes we're here til midnight. Sometimes she doesn't show up for three days.
Michael: Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
Gabe: Yeah, that would be awesome. I could get a girlfriend. Wouldn't have to go to Amsterdam seven times a year. But uh, I'm young, right?  I will date when I'm dead! [Laughs]
Michael: Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.
Michael: Hello Jo.
Jo: Anything I can do for you Puddin'?
Michael: There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
Jo: Hmm.
Michael: I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
Jo: All right then.
Michael: Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
Jo: Michael?
Michael: Yes.
Jo: I look forward to that too.
Andy: Ooh. It's coming down out there.
Erin: Yes. Thank you, for coming all the way here.
Andy: No, I-
Erin: I'm so sorry I was so sick. [Andy leans in. She leans in. Reid appears in background. Erin kisses Andy on the cheek.]
Andy: Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]
Michael: Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!
Meredith, Creed, Oscar and Matt: [cheering Michael]
Michael: Drinks are on me!
Oscar: No! No, no no! Put your credit cards away. Drinks are on us!
Michael: Oh -hoh! All right.
Michael: Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, 'Don't worry, be happy.'
Todd Packer: Whoops! [Humps Michael]
Michael: Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?
Jim: Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.
Dwight: What the hell is this?
Jim: Oh!
Dwight: This is not Mega-Desk.
Jim: No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.
Dwight: That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.
Jim: Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk]
Dwight: Hello, Dwight Schrute?
Michael: Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?
Jim: No.
Michael: Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
Jim: Is he you?
Michael: [laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
Jim: Where did you take that?
Michael: In my condo complex.
Jim: Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.
Michael: I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
Jim: Sure. That they should do one.
Michael: [feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
Jim: Who's that?
Michael: Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
Jim: John Dillinger.
Michael: No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Jim: Captain Crunch.
Michael: Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
Jim: At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Michael: Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
Jim: I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
Michael: I know, I know.
Jim: ...in your condo complex.
Michael: I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
Jim: M. Night Shulman?
Michael: [speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -
Stanley: When are we getting to sales topics?
Dwight: Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Michael: Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.
Phyllis: But is there anything relevant to the sales staff here?
Michael: No sales topic per se.
Andy: Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room]
Michael: Dwight?
Dwight: Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
Michael: I would like your undivided attention, please.
Dwight: You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Michael: Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.
Dwight: Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: When I was asking about the leads.
Michael: M-hmm.
Dwight: ... is there any news on the leads?
Michael: Is that all you have to say to me?
Dwight: Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!
Dwight: Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?
Angela: Hm-hm. Do you not answer e-mails anymore? Because I've e-mailed you four times asking you to come to my desk.
Phyllis: Honey, if I don't have time to answer an e-mail, I definitely don't have time to walk over to your desk.
Michael: Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]
Jim: Oh, sorry, wait one second.
Michael: Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
Jim: This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Michael: You writing your memoirs over there?
Jim: You writing your name over there?
Michael: Well, it's a pretty big check.
Jim: That's good. You know, with the kid.
Michael: Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
Jim: Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...
Michael: I'm just saying, that -
Jim: Michael - [Michael signs] Great.
Andy: [on phone] Very nice. Let me just, let me just write that down real quick. [motions to Darryl] Pencil? Can you give me that pencil? Hang on Teddy... [covers phone] I'm making a sale. Sales.
Darryl: There's other pencil's in this office.
Andy: Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]
Michael: Honey and jelly sandwich time. [removes lunch from fridge]
Darryl: Michael.
Michael: Oh, you got to be kidding me. [holds up squashed sandwich] Look at that. That's -
Darryl: I know who did that.
Michael: You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
Darryl: Didn't have to see. It was sales. I can feel it. They are out of control.
Michael: The sales department smashed my sandwich.
Darryl: Yes. All of 'em. Together. It's a conspiracy. Listen to me, Mike, you gotta do something about them.
Michael: You don't get it.
Darryl: You need to get back on top.
Michael: That's what she said.
Darryl: Yeah.
Michael: Yeah.
Erin: Something came for you, Michael. [hands him a parcel]
Michael: Thank you very much.
Jim: What'd you get?
Michael: Ah, just the stupid leads.
Jim: Alright!
Stanley: About time.
Andy: Me likey!
Phyllis: Finally, Michael. Hand 'em over, numbnuts. [Michael stares at her incredulously] But seriously. It's your job to give us those leads.
Michael: Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]
Stanley: We need those leads, Michael. It's our job Michael. Michael!
Gabe: [on phone] Michael, we spent a lot of money on those leads. You have to give them out.
Michael: Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
Gabe: Michael, I don't want to incentivise murder. But - we've tried to make it clear that our policy emphasises sales staff -
Michael: They act like I have no power.
Gabe: But you do. You are in charge -
Miichael: Thank you.
Gabe: - of supporting the sales staff. You are required to hand out those leads, Michael.
Michael: Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
Gabe: Okay, good.
Michael: Exactly that.
Gabe: Good.
Michael: Exactly that.
Gabe: Why do you keep repeating - [Michael hangs up]
Michael: Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! [hands him a lead]
Phyllis: What are you -
Michael: - and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead]
Stanley: They aren't salespeople!
Michael: And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar's shoulder].
Phyllis: What the hell do you think you're doing?
Michael: I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
Jim: Hey.
Michael: Hey.
Jim: So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Michael: Mm-hmm.
Jim: Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
Michael: Okay. [passes Jim some index cards]
Jim: Hey, alright.
Michael: Alright.
Jim: Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?
Michael: Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
Jim: I don't think you understand -
Michael: I do understand it.
Jim: [holds up card] This one's a map.
Michael: Or is it?
Angela: Oh, how the tables have turned. I see you got my e-mail.
Phyllis: Are you gonna give me the leads or not?
Angela: I'll give you the leads. But you know what? It's going to cost you some clerical work [hands her a mountain of paperwork]
Phyllis: What are these for?
Angela: It doesn't matter. Fill them out. All of them. Then when you're done, you can watch me shred them.
Kelly: I want to watch the Kardashians! I don't want to watch boring -
Ryan: It's my -
Stanley: The Kardashians is a good show.
Ryan: No it's - how would he even know the Kardashians?
Kelly: It's about a family. A real-life family.
Ryan: No, Stanley, do you -
Pam: [over phone] Hey baby, what's up?
Jim: I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
Pam: Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.
Jim: Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
Jim: Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.
Jim: How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'
Pam: He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.
Jim: I love you.
Michael: Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads: 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business.
Andy: Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.
Erin: Yeah. I basically wish you were dead. [grins] I hid the leads.
Andy: Where?
Erin: [mimes zipping mouth and throwing away key, Andy begins to walk away] Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Colder. Colder. Warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. [Andy hovers his hands above her chest] Hotter. Pretty hot. Lower.
Andy: Are you...
Erin: Lower.
Andy: Are you sure?
Erin: Lower [tilts head toward her desk, then flips over her keyboard, revealing the leads. Andy scratches his head, recovering]
Dwight: What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]
Jim: Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
Dwight: Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.'
Jim: [taps car] Lincoln.
Dwight: The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.
Jim: [holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.
Dwight: The leads are in?
Dwight: Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.
Michael: Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
Dwight: Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -
Kevin: You are never going to find them.
Dwight: Really.
Kevin: I'm going to enjoy this.
Dwight: [begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?
Kevin: [muffled] I'm still enjoying  it.
Dwight: Where are they?
Kevin: Turn the trash. Turn the trash.
Dwight: Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.
Meredith: [stands up and reaches for her buttons] Okey-dokey.
Kevin: No, dear god, no, it's in the trash can. In the kitchen.
Meredith: It's coming off anyway.
Dwight: [dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.
Kevin: What -
Erin: I emptied it in the dumpster. With Toby's baba ganoush.
Toby: If we don't patronise the only Syrian restaurant in town, there'll be nothing left but pan pizzas and make-your-own salads.
Dwight: [dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!
Michael: Wait. What day is today?
Kevin: Um, tonight is Ghost Whisperer. So, Friday.
Michael: Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!
Michael: Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -
Phyllis: Michael, why would we all go to the dump?
Michael: Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.'
Stanley: Not your staff, Michael. You.
Michael: Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
Toby: Does it have to be pizza? Could go for a, falafel?
Michael: Really?
Angela: I'm not going. You did this, not us.
Michael: Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!
Darryl: That sounds fun, mucking around in the dump. Wish I could go.
Michael: You can.
Darryl: I can't. You know that.
Michael: Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
Dwight: I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.
Dwight: [looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.
Michael: You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
Dwight: Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.
Michael: Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
Kelly: [to Oscar] You're adorable. You need to go for it. [Jim enters the break room] I'm going to be, like, mad at you if you don't -
Jim: Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.
Kelly: Why?
Jim: Just all the - drama.
Kelly: What drama?
Jim: Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?
Kelly: So unnecessary.
Jim: Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Kelly: I mean, if the salesmen weren't acting like such a bunch of stuck-up losers, then this day wouldn't be so bad - did you ever think of that?
Jim: I have new baby pictures.
Kelly: Don't use your cute baby to make us like you.
Jim: She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]
Stanley: If we act nice now, then we're rewarding them for treating us poorly.
Jim: Didn't we kind of start it?
Phyllis: I think you're remembering that wrong?
Andy: Yeah.
Phyllis: I don't know about this. I mean, I think we should hold our ground. The company's changed, and if they don't like it, they can leave. I mean, a lot of their work can be done from India.
Jim: Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?
Andy: All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -
Jim: I don't think we need opposed.
Michael: [kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.
Dwight: Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?
Michael: Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
Dwight: Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.
Michael: No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
Dwight: When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -
Michael: Assistant to the managed him -
Dwight: Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!
Michael: Yeah.
Dwight: Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.
Michael: You think you would have done better without me? Really?
Dwight: I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.
Michael: Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
Dwight: Kung-fu movies!
Michael: You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
Dwight: Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.
Michael: That's my wife you're talking about, man.
Dwight: Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!
Michael: If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
Dwight: Don't do it [lobs something at Michael]
Michael: No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!
Dwight: No! [lunges for a large wooden spool]
Michael: Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]
Dwight: [kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.
Phyllis: What's the least we can do to make this okay?
Jim: I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Andy: And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.
Phyllis: I guess we could give them some of our new commissions.
Stanley: That is a dangerous precedent.
Jim: Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
Phyllis: Oh, if they don't have an iPod by now they really don't want one.
Jim: Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
Phyllis: Okay, fine. Cash it is.
Andy: Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.
Michael: Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.
Dwight: Oh [half-heartedly throws something]
Michael: We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]
Dwight: [surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.
Phyllis: So how about, guys, one percent commission a month instead of two, what do you -
Jim: No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!
Meredith: [stares at the table filled with treats] Nice spread. We get it. You eat like royalty.
Jim: No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.
Andy: Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.
Phyllis: Yeah, we wanted to do the right thing. So...  [Jim gestures for her to continue]
Oscar: Way to go, guys. This was an integrity move.
Kevin: Yeah. When we walked in here, we were all prepared to tell you to go to hell.
Angela: Do you have any pastries without fruit?
Jim: Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.
Stanley: [enters room] Well, you better be happy, taking two percent of our -
Jim: - two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.
Phyllis: Our treats, Stanley, they've accepted our simple offer of treats. Nothing more.
Stanley: [beams] This is - nice! [pats Oscar's shoulder] All of us back together.
Michael: This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?
Dwight: Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?
Michael: Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?
Dwight: Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub]
Michael: Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:
Dwight: Hope - grows.
Michael: In the dump.
Dwight: [drives into office parking lot, honking horn. Enormous purple object strapped to the roof of their car] Woo hoo!
Stanley: Good news that you found our leads?
Michael: No! Better!
Dwight: We have an awesome bean bag chair that's perfect for the break room. [reaches out the window and pats it]
Phyllis: Yuck. I'm not going to sit on that disgusting seat.
Dwight: Yeah, damn right you're not. 'Cause it's for me and Michael only [they both cheer and high-five]
Andy: [at dump] It's freezing out here.
Erin: [strips off jacket] Go on. I have warm blood. [tries to drape her small jacket across Andy's back]
Andy: Oh wow, thank you. You're the nicest person I've ever met. [Andy and Erin kiss]
Dwight: [Michael grunts and strains while doing push-ups] Breathe. Work your core. Come on.
Michael: How many is that?
Dwight: Not counting the last one, 25.
Michael: Count the last one.
Dwight: Ok, 25 and one girl push-up!
Michael: Oh, new record!
Dwight: Okay.
Michael: Oh, what did you do today?
Jim: I made a sale.
Michael: Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
Meredith: What do we get if we do 'em?
Michael: My respect. [everyone returns to work] Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Dwight: And one girl push-up.
Michael: Gets to go home. [everyone starts to do push-ups] Ooh! I say 'dance,' they say 'how high?' Here we go. Oh, no. No, no, no. Butt to high. [steps on Angela] Disqualified!
Angela: Ow!
Michael: What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
Creed: [from desk chair] Oh, come on!
Jim: 19. [grunts] I had a really hard work out this morning.
Michael: [Stanley straining and breathing heavily] Oh, wow, that is adorable!
Phyllis: Ten...
Michael: Yeah, I'm betting one more.
Phyllis: Eleven, wow!
Michael: Good.
Everyone: [chanting] Stan-ley! Stan-ley! Stan-ley...
Michael: Alright, alright. [chanting continues]
Oscar: Essentially, what we have here is one of those stories where a mother lifts a car to save her baby.
Michael: Well, it's not exactly fair. He's got all of his weight that's helping him go down.
Dwight: 25. Yeah! Come on, you can do it!
Phyllis: One more, one more! [cheers and applause]
Oscar: You okay? You okay, Stanley?
Stanley: Excuse me.
Jim: Wow. [applause]
Oscar: Hey. Matt, right?
Matt: Hey, Oscar. You're here early.
Oscar: I always come in at 7.
Warehouse Guy: No, you don't.
Oscar: Well... Hey, uh, are you doing anything later tonight?
Matt: I don't know. I'm free. If you hear of anything going on, let me know.
Oscar: Yeah.
Oscar: Yeah, we talked this morning and we talked at Christmas. So, a little momentum there. [tries to open door, locked] Just a couple of hours to kill before work.
Darryl: Hey, what's up?
Oscar: Hey, nice office.
Darryl: Thanks, it's cool. So...
Oscar: You know what we haven't done in a while? Happy hour. Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody just going out for a drink.
Darryl: Has that ever happened? Ever?
Oscar: Didn't we? I think we did.
Darryl: You want me to invite Matt?
Oscar: Yeah, the whole gang, Matt included.
Darryl: Look, just be straight with me, man. You can be gay with Matt, just be straight with me.
Oscar: So happy hour.
Darryl: Happy hour. My pleasure.
Oscar: All right.
Oscar: So what do you think?
Phyllis: Hmmm, I saw a new drink on TV I'd like to try. I'll ask Bob.
Phyllis: Yeah, I love going to bars with Bob. I tend to wear something low-cut, get men to flirt with me, and Bob beats 'em up. What?
Andy: A bunch of us are talking about happy hour.
Jim: I would love, love, love to go. Only problem is, Pam's at home with the baby and I think she wants a night in.
Andy: Oh, baloney.
Jim: Good one.
Andy: Ring her up.
Jim: Absolutely, I will do that right now.
Jim: I gotta tell you, this baby is amazing. She gets me out of everything. And I - and I love her. I also love her, very much.
Jim: So some of the co-workers were thinking of going out tonight, but I told them-
Pam: [on phone] Yes! Yes! I would love to!
Andy: Ha! Knew it!
Pam: [through phone] It's been so long since I've been with adults. I am so excited to see everybody. Creed, Ryan. Oh my God, Stanley! Stanley's going to be there. Yes, oh my God!
Jim: I did not see this coming.
Andy: Erin, I need you to fax this and get me a confirmation, pronto. [whispering] Are you going later?
Erin: Sure, if you are.
Andy: Yes.
Erin: Talk to me that way again, and I'll cut your face off.
Andy: Whoa.
Andy: We recently struck up a romantic relationship. And, um...  but we're kinda keeping it quiet for now 'cause it's still kind of a new thing. It's a little delicate, and we just don't want all the drama.
Erin: Exactly.
Andy: Yeah, cause when everyone knows- [knock on window, open blinds to Kevin giggling and making sexual gestures] That's actually pretty funny, but in general, you know.
Erin: Quiet.
Andy: Hey, boss man.
Michael: Yes?
Andy: A bunch of us are going to get some drinks, you in?
Michael: Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time.
Andy: I'm sorry, I meant later.
Michael: Ok, yes. Sure.
Andy: For happy hour?
Michael: No, I got that.
Andy: Trying to get a head count.
Michael: I am in.
Andy: All right, yes! It's a deal.
Michael: It's a deal.
Pam: Oh, hey, I invited my friend Julie.
Jim: Okay.
Pam: I want her to meet Michael.
Jim: Why?
Pam: They're both single, I have a sense they might-
Jim: You've been gone for a long time.
Pam: It is not that. Kevin! Oh!
Kevin: Yeah! [hugs Pam]
Pam: Hey, how are you?
Kevin: Oh, I missed you so much.
Pam: Aw!
Kevin: Yeah!
Pam: Yeah!
Kevin: Waaah! [starts to make crying baby noises]
Kevin: When a new mom hears a baby cry, her you-know-what's fill up with you-know-what, and then her shirt gets, you know... that would be funny.
Michael: Oh, wow, I cannot believe this is happening. This is everything I dreamed. Oh, my God! [laughs]
Jim: Easy.
Michael: It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
Jim: Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
Michael: Sucks to be you.
Jim: Would you like to be our fourth?
Michael: That would be sublime.
Jim: All right.
Darryl: So, the guy shows me the deck he's built. And I'm like, 'I'll call this a deck if it'll make you happy, but this is just a porch without a roof.' [laughter, Oscar looks toward door] It was ridiculous man, it was like-you could maybe get two chairs on the thing. Two lawn chairs.
Pam: Hey, Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: This is my friend Julie.
Michael: Hello, how are you?
Julie: Good. Hi.
Michael: What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for? [Julie laughs]
Pam: Julie laughs at everything.
Julie: So you work with Pam and Jim?
Michael: Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
Julie: [giggles] I should hope not.
Michael: No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
Isabel: Hey.
Pam: Hey, Isabel, you made it. Oh, my goodness.
Isabel: Of course.
Pam: You want to play pool?
Isabel: Um, I'm gonna do a lap. See if I know anyone.
Pam: Ok.
Angela: And then they said the most ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper, which I do not have the decency to repeat, but trust me when I tell you that-
Dwight: Hold that thought. Well, well, well. If it isn't Isabel.
Isabel: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
Isabel: A girl like me is why a guy like you comes to a place like this.
Dwight: Ooh, I love repartee.
Isabel: Do you?
Dwight: Usually means there's a battle scene coming.
Michael: So, what do you do?
Julie: I am an ESL teacher.
Michael: Really?
Julie: Yeah.
Michael: See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
Julie: Are you thinking that I said 'ESP?'
Michael: Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
Julie: I was a little nervous when Pam told me he was her boss, but he doesn't act like a boss at all. If I had a boss like that, we'd never get anything done.
Jim: So what do you think?
Michael: About what?
Jim: About Julie?
Michael: She's nice.
Jim: Yeah.
Michael: Yeah.
Jim: So you like her?
Michael: Uh, yeah, sure.
Jim: So Pam was right?
Michael: About what?
Jim: About you two hitting it off.
Michael: [removing tie] Well, apparently, Michael Scott is on a date. And that, that my friend, changes everything. [puts on backwards golf cap]
Hide: My brother, good head, bad heart. Good head, bad heart.
Oscar: I know.
Pam: Hey, Michael, where have you been? [Michael shoots pool ball up into their faces]
Jim: Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
Pam: Why are you wearing a hat now?
Michael: Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
Michael: Hi, I'm date Mike. Nice to meet me. How do you like your eggs in the morning? [tries to wink]
Jim: You want to just make a run for it?
Pam: Maybe.
Kevin: Waaaah! [Kevin fake-cries into Pam's chest] Waaaaah! Mommy!
Jim: What is happening?
Andy: Whoa! What is crackin?
Ryan: Guys, one second. [on dance videogame]
Kelly: We're focusing, we're focusing, we can't talk.
Erin: What's this game?
Ryan: One second.
Andy: Yeah, how do you play?
Ryan: Guys, guys, guys, please. [game ends] Ok, all right, it's all yours now.
Kelly: Only three tickets.
Ryan: If we save 'em up, we can get more than a sticker this time.
Kelly: Stop telling me how to spend my tickets.
Ryan: I know, but you wanted the big thing.
Andy: Wow, can you imagine what people would say if they saw us dancing together?
Erin: Oh I know.
Andy: They'd be like, 'what's up with those two?'
Erin: Hey, guys, get a bedroom already.'
Andy: Did we miss the wedding?' Um, I got it-I'll do this, and you play the racing game, and then we'll switch.
Erin: Yes, okay. Yeah, that's smart.
Andy: No drama. Ok.
Isabel: Oh, air hockey, basketball, we could play that. Oh, whack-a-mole.
Dwight: Any brothers or sisters?
Isabel: Three brothers.
Dwight: Really?
Isabel: Two are in the Marines, one's a cop.
Dwight: Vegetarian?
Isabel: No. I love meat.
Dwight: What's your blood type?
Isabel: O-negative. Universal donor.
Dwight: Universal donor. [startled by Angela, curses]
Dwight: Angela versus Isabel. Height, advantage Isabel. Birthing hips, advantage Isabel. Remaining child-bearing years, advantage Isabel. Legal obligation, advantage Angela.
Michael: Hey, guys, guys, guys. [steals a cherry from waitress passing buy] Watch this. Ready?
Julie: What are you doing?
Michael: I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
Jim: Michael, you don't have to do this.
Michael: [choking] Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
Michael: I would say I kind of have an unfair advantage because I watch reality dating shows like a hawk, and I learn. I absorb information from the strategies of the winners and the losers. Actually, I probably learn more from the losers.
Phyllis: Hey, you two having fun?
Andy: Did you tell them?
Erin: No.
Andy: This is exactly what I don't want, the drama. I don't want the drama!
Erin: I get it.
Isabel: [Isabel and Dwight playing whack-a-mole] You are amazing at this. How did you get so good?
Dwight: Whacking moles. Hit 'em on the head. Whack. Say it with me.
Isabel: Whack!
Dwight: Extend the fingers more.
Isabel: Whack!
Dwight: Good.
Angela: This looks like a hoot.
Dwight: Hey, monkey, how you doing?
Angela: Whack.
Dwight: Listen, can I talk to you for a second?
Angela: Okay.
Dwight: Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.
Angela: It's no worry.
Dwight: It's just that we both-we want different things. You know, I want a big family.
Angela: I could see enjoying that.
Dwight: No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
Angela: But we signed the contract.
Dwight: Dissolved. Don't worry, you're free. Okay? Okay. See you later.
Angela: We both-you didn't dup-
Jim: [Michael playing air guitar on pool table] Wow. Maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this.
Pam: Maybe it should come from a man.
Jim: Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.
Bar Manager: Hello.
Michael: Hello.
Bar Manager: Hi.
Michael: Hi.
Bar Manager: You wanna pay 400 bucks to re-felt this table?
Michael: Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
Pam: Hey, Michael, why don't you just get down.
Michael: Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.
Bar Manager: Ted, are we having fun?
Michael: Really? You told on me. That's lame.
Bouncer: We got a problem?
Michael: Yes. Homelessness. What?
Bar Manager: All right, go.
Michael: Where?
Bar Manager: Get out. Now.
Michael: Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry.
Pam: Ok, um, why don't we just finish the game? Michael, it's your shot.
Michael: She can't talk to us that way.
Pam: You guys are stripes, I think...
Michael: You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
Jim: It stopped.
Michael: Well, I am starting it again!
Pam: Do you guys want some food? The wings are really good here.
Michael: Hey, you embarrassed my friends in front of me and I'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize.
Bar Manager: Then I am sorry that I didn't kick you out.
Michael: I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.
Bar Manager: Well, uh, I'm the manager here, sir.
Michael: Well, it just so happens that I am a manager too. And the way I manage people is that I touch their hearts and souls with humor, with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle. And I don't see that from you.
Bar Manager: Is that how you do it?
Michael: Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.
Bar Manager: Really? How much have you written?
Michael: I've written all of it... in my head.
Bar Manager: Oh.
Michael: If you're really interested, it's called 'Somehow I Manage' and there's going to be a picture of me on the cover, shrugging, with my sleeves rolled up.
Bar Manager: Huh. Have you read Lee Iacocca's? It's a classic.
Michael: Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.
Bar Manager: Dude, tonight! You're not going to want to put it down. It's gonna make you want to go out and buy a Chrysler tomorrow.
Michael: I own a Chrysler.
Bar Manager: Shut up.
Michael: No, you shut up.
Bar Manager: What's your drink?
Michael: Grenadine.
Bar Manager: What?
Andy: We just have to throw everyone off the scent a little, so follow my lead.
Erin: Okay.
Andy: [Andy sits at table with another woman] Hi.
Girl at table: Hi.
Andy: I don't normally do this, but...
Girl at table: Do what?
Andy: Just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people.
Erin: [Erin sits with man, rubs her hand on his thigh] Hey, big boy. Do you like it when I do that?
Andy: [Andy spits out his drink] What are you doing?
Erin: What we said to do.
Andy: We didn't say we were gonna, like, start groping strangers!
Erin: I was flirting with a man.
Andy: Get in here. [Andy and Erin go into photo booth] Where did you learn to talk like that?
Erin: The movies. I don't know.
Andy: Well, what movie? Black Snake Moan?
Michael: I manage a paper company-Dunder Mifflin/Sabre.
Bar Manager: You have a card?
Michael: I did. I actually put it in your bowl.
Bar Manager: Stanley Hudson?
Michael: No, no.
Bar Manager: Whoa, a lot of Stanley Hudson's in here.
Michael: No, it's Michael Scott.
Bar Manager: Michael Scott?
Michael: He is I.
Bar Manager: You just won yourself a lunch.
Michael: Oh, hey guys. [thumbs up]
Julie: I think I'm gonna go.
Pam: Really?
Julie: Yeah.
Pam: I'm sorry, he's not usually like that.
Julie: What's he usually like?
Pam: He's more, just... like... you can go.
Julie: Yeah.
Jim: All right.
Pam: Okay. Bye.
Jim: See ya. Nice girl.
Pam: Yeah.
Michael: Hey, Julie! You having fun? [Julie leaves]
Bar Manager: So... when are you coming in for that free lunch? You're gonna want to come in on a day that I'm working. Uh, maybe I can hear more about that book, too.
Darryl: Hey, man, you put together a pretty fun night for everybody. I saw you talking to Hide. Did you hear that dude's life story? It's amazing, right?
Oscar: I couldn't understand a word he said.
Darryl: Let me tell you something, Oscar. All right, Matt's an okay dude, but he's a dummy. You guys got nothing in common.
Oscar: Maybe you're right. I should count myself lucky.
Matt: Hey, what's up?
Oscar: There he is! Hey, hey, hey.
Matt: Anyone up for some hoops?
Oscar: Sure. Hoops!
Matt: Let's do it.
Oscar: Hoop it up, right.
Andy: This is not what I want my relationship to look like. [holding photo strip of he and Erin fighting]
Andy: [over PA] Hi, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Andrew Bernard, and I've been on two dates with Erin Hannon and they went well, and there will probably be more. Thank you.
Andy: You know, it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama. And I hate drama, so there you go.
Erin: [laughs] You love drama.
Andy: I know, I do, right? I'm a total drama queen.
Dwight: With this move, he can't get you.
Isabel: Well, I think that he could counter that move. The Scranton strangler is a professional strangler.
Dwight: Oh, please. I wish he'd come after me.  I would be like-aaah!
Angela: Dwight Schrute! Dwight Kurt Schrute.
Dwight: Sh-what?
Angela: You are hereby served with a summons to appear in Lackawanna county court.
Dwight: No, no, no. [trying to talk over her] Blah blah blah blah!
Angela: For breach of contract with Angela Noelle Martin.
Isabel: What are you talking about?
Dwight: What are you-
Angela: Dwight recently entered into a contract with me, establishing intent to conceive and raise a child with me.
Dwight: Angela...
Angela: Did he not tell you that?
Dwight: You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
Angela: Do you plan on raising a child with me? Or do you plan on breaking this contract?
Dwight: Angela, not here!
Angela: Dwight?
Isabel: Whack! [Isabel smacks Angela on forehead]
Angela: You'll see me in small claims court!
Dwight: You are an impressive specimen.
Isabel: Thank you. [Dwight and Isabel kiss]
Kelly: [crying] Then, I spilled my drink, and they wouldn't give me a refill.
Pam: Oh-oh, gosh. Oh.
Jim: You all right?
Pam: Okay, we have to get home.
Kevin: Yeah!
Michael: Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady.
Jim: Actually, you didn't.
Pam: Not at all.
Michael: I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
Darryl: Tell 'em your story, Hide.
Hide: In Japan, heart surgeon. Number one. Steady hand. One day, yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But, mistake! Yakuza boss die. Yakuza very mad. I hide in fishing boat, come to America. No English,  no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car, and new woman. Darryl save life. My big secret:  I kill yakuza boss on purpose. I good surgeon. The best!
Michael: After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.
Michael: Erin... what are you doing?
Erin: Guys! Guys. Did you guys know that our own Michael Scott has made a movie, and that he maybe will let us watch it, but only if everybody's dying to see it.
Michael: That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
Jim: Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.
Pam: We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.
Jim: Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!
Pam: Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.
Pam: We'd love to see it!
Michael: Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
Pam: Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?
Creed: Thanks mom.
Holly: You never told me you made a movie.
Michael: Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
Holly: It's got you.
Michael: It's got a lot of me.
Holly: [laughs] I can't wait.
Michael: Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]
Dwight: I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.
Michael: Dwight does not play a robot.
Daryl: I gave up a lot of weekends because I thought it'd be good for my daughter to see a black man as president. Even in a silly home movie. What a stupid waste of time.
Jim: I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.
Dwight: He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?
Jan: He finished his movie? [frantically trying to open her car door, as if trying to get away from the camera crew] No kidding. Wow, that's great. Yeah that's good for him.
Michael: By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.
Michael: That was not scripted.
Karen: Why are you singling my line out, like, a million years later?
Jim: [cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.
Michael: [turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]
Jim: I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Kelly: Yeah Michael the movie is amazing!
Kevin: It's like one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.
Ryan: You should enter it in festivals!
Kevin: Or carnivals!
Michael: [to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
Holly: Uh... which part?
Michael: Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
Andy: Some people are really popping on screen!
Michael: Hey.
Holly: Hey! Good movie.
Michael: Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
Holly: I loved it.
Michael: Did you? What did you love about it?
Holly: Uhm, I loved that you got to work together with all your friends. Isn't that great when you can all work together like that?
Michael: No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.
Holly: Uhm...
Michael: Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
Holly: Not worried about that.
Michael: [angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
Holly: Wha- It's your dream and you never even mentioned it before!
Michael: I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
Holly: Well why do you have to make a movie at all?
Michael: Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
Holly: Really, you can't think of anything else that you might have?
Michael: I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
Holly: I'm real.
Michael: Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
Holly: I love you too.
Michael: I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.
Michael: Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval]
Michael: We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.
Jim: [he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!
Michael: No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]
Michael: Hey...
Holly: Hey, I'm sorry. It is good.
Michael: No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
Michael: [laughs at the stupidity]
Michael: Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.
Andy: [the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?
Michael: Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!
Dwight: No no, he's doing it to catch the president!
Michael: No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]
Dwight: I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.
Kevin: You're eating eight year old tomatoes?
Dwight: They're still good for another week.
Meredith: You know, I think I have some type of cheese in the back of my fridge you might like. [Jim smiles]
Kevin: I've got some cheese you might like too. In between my toes. [all laugh]
Dwight: Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?
Jim: Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
Dwight: No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
Jim: Three months.
Dwight: Could be.
Jim: Four months.
Dwight: I can see that happening, yes.
Jim: Eight months?
Dwight: That's a realistic time line.
Jim: [Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.
Dwight: Perhaps.
Jim: Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.
Dwight: I can see that as a very real possibility.
Jim: [time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Dwight: I can see that happening.
Jim: Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
Todd: I really though I was becoming too much of a womanizer. I realized I had shirts in five different women's houses.
Michael: Still not seeing the problem here.
Todd: All right, truth is I gotta couple love bumps on my ding-dong so, game-over!
Michael: It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.
Holly: [walks into conference room with Michael and Todd] Hi!
Michael: Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss]
Holly: You must be Todd.
Todd: [shaking Holly's hand] Whoa! I'm sorry, Michael. I thought we were meeting Holly today, not Jennifer Aniston!
Holly: [laughs oddly] Very funny. Okay let's get started.
Todd: After you!
Michael: Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
Michael: Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.
Holly: All right.
Michael: And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Holly: I already have.
Michael: Whoa!
Jim: [to Michael] Why is Packer back?
Michael: Is Packer here?
Dwight: Why's he talking to Holly?
Michael: [peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.
Holly: [to Todd] Michael loves you, and your sales speak for themselves.
Todd: [excitedly] Oh!
Michael: [sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
Kevin: Yes!
Jim: What!?
Todd: It's great to be among friends, but until then, you suckers will do!
Kevin: Nice! We got burned!
Michael: You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Dwight: [seething] Holly, you approved this?
Holly: Yes I did, I think Todd's gonna make a great addition to the staff.
Jim: You did approve it?
Holly: Yeah.
Kevin: What don't you understand about the word approved? It seems some of you don't know what the word approved means.
Kevin: I have very little patience for stupidity.
Erin: [walking in with Gabe behind her] Sorry we're late. Gabe fell in the shower.
Gabe: I'm such a klutz!
Erin: Yeah, it took the fire department forever to get there. [realizing there's a new computer at her desk. Gets very excited] Oh my God, where did this come from?! Who did this?!
Pam: I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?
Erin: Thank you Pam.
Pam: Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.
Jim: [Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?
Pam: I just helped someone out. It feels good.
Jim: Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Pam: So you know the feeling.
Michael: Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.
Dwight: I didn't order anything.
Michael: And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
Dwight: Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
Michael: So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]
Todd: Thanks man, it'd mean a lot.
Dwight: I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
Todd: well I was there for twelve years. Plus my name's carved under the desk.
Dwight: No it is not.
Todd: Is too!
Michael: [Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.
Todd: Check it out!
Dwight: I don't wanna move desks!
Michael: Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Jim: Do I have any say in this?!
Michael: No!
Todd: [grunting while humping Michael and Dwight] Don't even watch, Halpert!
Dwight: [in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?
Holly: Oh, that's our Zen garden.
Dwight: What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]
Pam: [walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...
Holly: Hey, what's up guys?
Meredith: Don't what's up us! You think you're so cute, with your pretty blonde hair!
Jim: Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?
Holly: Uhm.
Pam: He's seriously awful!
Holly: Michael's recommendation was glowing! And, honestly, he's been nothing but nice to me!
Meredith: That's how he gets you to take off his panties.
Jim: [Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?
Pam: United front...
Holly: Okay, look. We can't fire someone because we don't like him.
Ryan: Right this isn't the U.S. Government.
Kelly: What are you referencing?
Ryan: [seems unsure] Everything... Everything.
Holly: Do any of you have any concrete complaints about something he's done?
Jim: Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Holly: Well if that's the case, I guess I've gotta be fired too. [all groan in disgust]
Andy: [looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.
Erin: Hey sailor! Come watch it over here! [pats her new computer]
Andy: Where did you get this?!
Erin: Pam gave it to me!
Andy: This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?
Pam: You have a computer Andy.
Andy: Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...
Pam: Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.
Andy: Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...
Pam: Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.
Stanley: So something good happening to Stanley is crazy now?
Andy: I'm not asking for one, I need it.
Phyllis: If you're just handing them out, I want one too.
Andy: Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.
Pam: See, this is what I'm talking about.
Andy: What are you gonna play mange on faster?
Pam: Sorry Andy.
Todd: Hey what's going on you guys? [walking into the kitchen with Holly, Dwight, and Kevin, with whom he fist bumps] Yeahh! Three muska-queers!
Kevin: [giggling] Mean but good!
Holly: So, Todd, this must be nice for you getting off the road. You get to spend some time with your daughter.
Todd: I don't know, I love her and all, but she turned into a bitch. Mostly she's great, but some days she acts like her mom. [Holly is un-amused]
Holly: Well, some girls go through a phase.
Kevin: Hey, your life is so insane! You should write a book!
Todd: Since when did you learn how to read?
Kevin: I do know how to read though!
Todd: Yeah. You know how to read... a menu!
Kevin: [Todd leaves. Kevin laughs uncertainly] He's right. I mean, I could lose some weight.
Dwight: Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
Pam: [walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!
Andy: It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.
Pam: What? Erin is that true?
Erin: [nods] I just thought, he really needed a new computer, and he knew so much about that one.
Pam: Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.
Andy: Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-
Pam: I'm not freaking out, Andy.
Andy: -take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?
Pam: Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?
Andy: That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.
Pam: Switch the computers back Andy.
Andy: Seriously?
Pam: Seriously.
Andy: Pam! Come on!
Pam: Now please.
Andy: Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!
Erin: [to Holly who is walking by] Oh! If you're going back to the annex, could you take these to Dwight? I think the ants are waking up. They need to start farming soon. [picks up an ant farm and tube of ants from her desk, Holly takes them] Thanks.
Michael: Best day ever. Best day ever!
Holly: So much happening. [not as excited as Michael]
Michael: Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Holly: No! No.
Michael: Please.
Holly: Did Todd tell you to do that?
Michael: Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.
Holly: I love you.
Michael: No. Not me, him.
Holly: That's certainly opinionated.
Erin: [looking anxious] If you're not gonna take the ants over I should probably just do it myself.
Holly: Oh I'm going.
Michael: Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
Holly: I don't think he's funnier than me.
Michael: He's funnier than me.
Holly: No, he's not funny at all.
Michael: So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
Erin: [very anxious at this point] Gee! Uh oh! I think the ants are starting to eat each other!
Holly: No, what I'm saying is, he's not funny, but you're funnier than he is.
Michael: [seems taken aback] Uhm...
Holly: Ok: Bill Cosby [puts the ant tube high up. Each time she mentions a name it gets lower], Steve Martin, Charlie Bit My Finger, Michael Scott, then all the way down here [tube takes a jump to the bottom] Todd Packer.
Michael: That's insane!
Holly: Honey, he's a jerk.
Erin: [getting up and walking towards them, worriedly] For Pete's sake it just needs to be done! [takes the ant farm and tube from Holly and heads towards the annex]
Todd: [to Jim] So you two are married to each other now, right?
Jim: Yeah.
Todd: That's sweet. How's the sex?
Jim: [continues working]
Dwight: [walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Todd: Why?
Dwight: Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Jim: That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious]
Dwight: Drink it!
Todd: I think I'll pass. The only hot chocolate I'm into is Viva A Fox. [winks]
Jim: [interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?
Jim: So, this hot chocolate thing.
Dwight: None of your business.
Jim: Well, you know you can't actually poison him.
Dwight: It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.
Jim: I really think we should join forces on this one.
Dwight: Really.
Jim: What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
Dwight: I know.
Jim: Here we go.
Dwight: Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
Jim: You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Dwight: [mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Jim: Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
Dwight: Who is Justice Beaver?
Jim: He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Dwight: Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Jim: Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
Dwight: Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Andy: Pam. Can I talk to you in private?
Pam: I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.
Andy: Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.
Pam: [looking confused] You did that?
Andy: Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.
Pam: Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-
Andy: Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.
Pam: Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?
Andy: You humiliated me in front of every body!
Pam: Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.
Andy: I mean, it's pretty broken already.
Pam: Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.
Andy: [looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door]
Ryan: [walking in] Hey cats, we got a jazz session in mod six, nine, and twelve. [Pam and Andy exit as Ryan and others holding saxophones walk in, Pam looks at the sign up sheet in awe]
Dwight: [to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]
Jim: Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
Dwight: They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-
Jim: One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Dwight: Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
Andy: [Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!
Todd: [at Hank's with Michael, talking to Hank] And a '76 that's good to boot, I like that. [Hank smiles]
Michael: And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]
Todd: Why?
Michael: I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
Todd: Holly said that?
Michael: Yeah.
Holy: She was laughing hysterically that whole time!
Michael: I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
Todd: She asked me, Michael! It would've been rude not to answer.
Michael: You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
Todd: Michael, can I open the kamomo with you. I've been on the road too long. But, I wanna connect with my daughter. And it's not right to call her a bitch in front of strangers.
Michael: No it isn't.
Todd: You're right. I gotta watch my behavior.
Michael: Yeah, a little bit.
Todd: Don't give up on me.
Michael: I won't.
Michael: [Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.
Kevin: I got a lot of numbers here to put together.
Michael: Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
Kevin: That's silly. If anything, I should be apologizing to Packer. Because we all know I can dish it, as good as I can take it.
Michael: Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Todd: I'm sorry if you were offended by my comments earlier.
Kevin: Well, like I said, I wasn't offended, but I'll stand here for the big show.
Michael: Kevin, do you accept the apology?
Kelly: Don't do it Kevin, that's the fake kind of apology.
Michael: Okay, go back to the annex.
Kelly: This is textbook. It's so uncool. Ryan does this to me all the time. Like it's some offense to have feelings. Don't do it Kevin.
Ryan: [muttering] Sometimes you over react.
Oscar: Michael how's this supposed to work? Packer's gonna keep saying terrible things, and then he's just gonna make half-assed apologies. And we're back to square one.
Todd: Okay. You want an apology? Here it goes. Kevin, I am so sorry. You are skinny, and you are a genius.
Michael: That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
Angela: [cutting in] No! Don't!
Michael: I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
Pam: [in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.
Andy: No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.
Pam: Andy, this is the deal we made.
Andy: [watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.
Pam: We should break this hinge maybe.
Andy: Let's not go crazy.
Todd: Well thanks, will do.
Jim: [using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]
Todd: That sounds weird.
Jim: It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Dwight: [also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
Jim: [trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
Dwight: Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
Todd: Apparently, as soon as corporate found out I wanted to come in off the road, Jo offered me a cushy new job in Tallahassee. And here's the best part. I'm a huge alligator nerd. I can name you every genus, every sub species. Also I'm a huge boob nerd.
Dwight: Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!
Michael: What are you doing?
Jim: [trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]
Michael: I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
Jim: He's a jerk.
Dwight: He took my desk.
Michael: Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
Dwight: It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
Michael: You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Dwight: No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
Michael: He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
Jim: Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves]
Andy: [plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?
Pam: Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!
Andy: Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?
Pam: Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]
Andy: All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]
Todd: [walking into Michael's office] You're looking at the new face of corporate. Gonna put the 'ass', in Tallahassee!
Michael: Yes, about that.
Todd: Well we gotta go out and celebrate, tonight!
Michael: Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
Todd: Do you have a ball and chain?
Michael: No, nothing like that at all.
Todd: Listen, I'm gonna tell you something that none of these people have the stones to tell you. It's your girlfriend, man. She's uptight.
Michael: Sorry?
Todd: I know this stuff can hurt, but I wish someone had said something to me about my ex-wife. All I'm saying is about a month or so, meet me down in Florida, I'll introduce you to all the local [spanks the air] talent.
Michael: [thinks a moment] Sounds great.
Todd: It's gonna be so good.
Michael: That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
Holly: I'm sorry about your friend.
Michael: Nah, he's an ass.
Holly: [Brooklyn accent] You ahh.
Michael: [imitating] You ahh.
Holly: What ah you wicked smaht?
Michael: No you ahh.
Holly: Who ahh?
Michael: [kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.
Daryl: So this new computer you found in the warehouse.
Pam: Yep. Lucked out.
Daryl: Yeah, you really did. 'Cause I know every INCH of that warehouse.
Pam: Yep, super lucky.
Daryl: Maybe you could go back down there and see if you can find me some extra sick days.
Pam: [hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.
Daryl: Really? 'Cause I think maybe I saw five.
Pam: Three. [Daryl nods]
Pam: I'm full on corrupt!
Pam: Hey Oscar, big Will and Grace fan huh?
Oscar: No. Everybody assumes I am. I always get them as gifts.
Pam: Oh.
Pam: Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.
Dwight: People! Look alive. It's showtime. Doors open in 3...2...1.
Jim: Oh, yikes.
Pam: It's cold Dwight. Just shut the door and let people come in the front.
Dwight: It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Pam: The signs will drive people inside.
Dwight: The warmth will lure people inside.
Andy: Close it.
Dwight: This is how business...
Andy: Close it.
Dwight: I'm not closing the door.
Andy: Close it. [starts wrestling Dwight]
Dwight: Stop it.
Andy: Just close it.
Dwight: Uh oh, looks like someone's sign is a little crooked. Uh, looks awful. Need a thumb tack?
Meredith: Sure.
Dwight: Not so fast.
Dwight: Schrute's are farmers by hobby, and traders by trade. Through the art of the swap, I will walk out of this garage sale with the finest item here.
Dwight: I will trade you for the used candle.
Meredith: Forget you.
Dwight: Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
Meredith: Fine, just give it.
Dwight: That's how it's done.
Kevin: Woah, I love her. How much for that?
Michael: I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
Holly: 10 dollars.
Michael: Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
Kevin: 200
Michael: 500
Holly: 20
Kevin: 45
Michael: Get lost.
Kevin: Damn it.
Michael: That is how you do it.
Holly: You know we don't have to sell that if you don't want to. If it's a problem with the neon I can have my neon guy take a look.
Michael: You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
Holly: Well we could put it in storage... in case.
Michael: In case... in case of what?
Holly: You know... in case if something changes.
Michael: I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
Holly: Nope.
Lady: How much for the slip and slide?
Michael: Get lost.
Michael: [on phone] Yes, hello Mr. Flax this is Michael Scott, your daughter's boss. I am calling because I am going to have to fire your daughter Holly because she is such a terrible employee. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm actually calling because I'm in love with her. I love your daughter, and I have for some time. And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.
Kelly: Are you serious? A half used candle? Get out of here Dwight. You're blocking my table with your giant body.
Dwight: Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Kelly: Screw you man. People like my stuff.
Dwight: People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
Kelly: You can take my Helen Fielding collection.
Dwight: And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
Andy: Oh my gosh, you have the Dallas board game?
Kevin: Yea when I was a kid I was on Dallas.
Andy: Really?
Kevin: Yea. When I was kid we missed our connecting flight and we spent the entire day on Dallas. Then we spent a week on Hawaii... I was in heaven.
Darryl: We should play it.
Andy: Well... there's no instructions.
Darryl: It's Dallas the game, we can figure it out.
Kevin: Yea.
Andy: I'm pretty good at board games.
Darryl: Well, shall we make it a little interesting?
Andy: Sure.
Dwight: What is this?
Jim: How did those get out? I'm sorry.
Dwight: Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
Jim: I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
Dwight: That's a common swindlers trick.
Jim: Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
Dwight: So you wanna sell me magic beans. [laughs]
Jim: Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Dwight: Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
Holly: Michael called Dad?
Holly's Mom: Your friend Michael, yes. What's going on?
Holly: Um, I think I know. But I'll sound stupid if I'm wrong but is Dad there?
Holly's Dad: Holly?
Holly: Hi Dad.
Holly's Dad: There was a program on TV about India.
Holly: Um, ok. Did you connect with Michael?
Holly's Dad: Wanna watch it?
Holly: I... I'm not there Dad, I'm in Pennsylvania.
Holly's Dad: What are you doing there?
Holly: I live here. Um, can I talk to you about Michael?
Holly's Dad: I'll, I'll put your mother on.
Holly: No. No... no Dad.
Holly's Mom: Holly?
Holly: Mom, Dad can't seem to focus on a subject.
Holly's Mom: Don't you worry about him, he's got me.
Holly: Well who do you have?
Holly's Mom: I have your father. He's right here I'll put him on.
Holly: No. Mom?
Pam: Oh, which one is decaf?
Pam: [looks out window] Michael! Michael!
Michael: Hi.
Pam: Hi..  I was just coming out to see what you were doing and to maybe stop you.
Michael: Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
Pam: Why do you need more gas?
Michael: Well, I'm writing a message.
Pam: Is it a good message or a bad message?
Michael: I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
Pam: Are you proposing!?
Michael: Maybe.
Pam: Wow.
Michael: Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
Pam: Yea. Yea no problem. [runs away]
Michael: Pam.
Pam: Yep.
Micahel: Could you light this please?
Pam: Michael, you've had two ideas today. And one of them was great. And the other one was terrible.
Michael: I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
Pam: This is terrible.
Michael: No, this is romantic.
Pam: You know what? I'm gonna get a hose. Then we'll talk about it. Ok we'll figure it out. Be right back. Just stay there.
Ryan: Free sample?
Ryan: My mom makes the best pesto in the world. And I always tell her 'Mom you should sell this, you'd make a fortune' and she always says 'No it's just for family.' Well finally I was like f*** it, I'll sell it so I'm like 'Mom, I need you to make a ton of pesto for a pesto party for all my friends' and she's like 'uh, ok' ... pesto party? Really? Anyway... she makes like a hundred bottles worth. It's so good. And Phyllis... just had that mom look I wanted.
Dwight: You got this kosher certified?
Ryan: No I meant like uh, it's cool, its kosher, it's all good.
Dwight: Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects. [laughs]
Ryan: Thank you. Whatcha got there?
Dwight: Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Dwight: things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.
Dwight: Jim, put those away.
Jim: [pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
Dwight: just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
Jim: They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]
Pam: Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.
Michael: Why?
Pam: You called the meeting I don't..
Michael: I did?
Michael: Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.
Pam: Michael.
Michael: Yes.
Pam: We are a family.
Michael: I could not have agreed with you more.
Pam: And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.
Michael: Yes. Thank you.
Pam: So about this proposal thing...
Michael: No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
Pam: Michael, she's perfect for you.
Oscar: She's the one.
Jim: She's amazing. This is very exciting.
Pam: So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.
Michael: I had a great idea until you ruined it.
Oscar: Wanna know how to do it? Here's how you do it. Take her out to dinner. Go down on one knee. If you are in costume, you did something wrong. If at any point you find yourself tying a ring to a dogs collar, stop, and look at yourself.
Andy: [playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .
Kevin: Nice.
Andy: And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.
Kevin: No you cant do that. You cant play a black mail card and call a proxy meeting in the same turn.
Andy: Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.
Darryl: And I'm gonna play this here share the wealth card.
Andy: Oooh.
Darryl: Which entitles me to half of both of y'alls money so if you don't mind.
Kevin: no this card is from the wrong game this is from the game of life.
Darryl: It was in the box.
Andy: Well played.
Darryl: Thank you.
Andy: We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.
Kevin: No but that's not fair.
Andy: Well that's Dallas.
Darryl: Dallas indeed.
Oscar: What... Ryan, where did you get this picture? [a picture of Oscar on Ryans bottles of salsa]
Ryan: My mom also makes the best salsa.
Holly: This is your moms old stuff?
Phyllis: Yeah mostly.
Holly: How's she doing?
Phyllis: It didn't go down so easy but she's made some friends and it's already better than it was.
Holly: How do you know when its time?
Phyllis: Uh I don't know if you ever know. And if you wait for the day when your parent to comes to you and says 'I cant take care of myself anymore' its never gonna happen. I have a box of bras under the table if you're interested.
Holly: Let me see.
Pam: Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?
Ryan: Blogs are out but people are texting each other no more animals
Michael: How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
Jim: That's a guarantee.
Michael: It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
Jim: Don't think you need the corpse then.
Michael: Heres the ring.
Pam: Holy s*** is that real?
Michael: Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
Oscar: No. [shakes head back and forth]
Michael: Is she not going to like that?
Pam: No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.
Oscar: Where was that.
Jim: At a gas station. [oscar laughs]
Michael: At a gas station?
Jim: Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.
Michael: That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
Pam: No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..
Michael: Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
Jim: Totally reasonable.
Michael: I just... it's terrifying.
Pam: She's not gonna say no.
Michael: I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Jim: Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Pam: You were scared?
Jim: Yeah... it.s scary.
Michael: Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.'
Holly: Look I need to talk to you.
Michael: Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Holly: I think I need to go home to Colorado. My dad isn't doing so well.
Michael: Oh ok. For how long?
Holly: I don't know.
Michael: Is he alright?
Holly: Yeah.
Michael: You ok?
Holly: Yeah, yeah it's just you know I don't want to go home when he's on his death bed you know, I wanna be there when he's still my dad.
Michael: Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
Holly: And I want you to come with me. Now I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend..
Michael: Ok.
Holly: And I was thinking... you know maybe since given our last conversation that we're both ready... Michael Scott will you..
Michael: No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
Holly: Uh, what?
Michael: No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.
Kevin: Hey guys it's my turn.
Andy: You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.
Kevin: Yeah I told you, you can't shoot people.
Darryl: I told you we're way past rules. We have been for some time now. We start having rules now, everything we built collapses.
Kevin: This is stupid and I want my money back. Where's the money?
Darryl: Yeah where is it?
Kevin: Ok you know what? I am never ever playing board games with you two again.
Kevin: And that is Dallas. [shows money]
Ryan: Nice.
Jim: Not bad right. [swinging golf club]
Ryan: Can't really tell the...
Jim: [to Dwight] Nice.
Dwight: I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?
Jim: Oh my God.
Dwight: That... that's impossible.
Jim: It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
Dwight: All right, I'll take them.
Jim: They're probably worthless.
Dwight: Probably. [walks away with beans]
Jim: Leave the telescope.
Dwight: I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.
Michael: Hey, how'd we do?
Holly: 13 dollars.
Michael: That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
Holly: Listen about earlier ...
Michael: No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
Holly: It was wrong to put you in that position and... Michael you are my life now. I'm not going to Colorado.
Michael: Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
Michael: So this is one of my favorite places in the world.
Holly: Why?
Michael: This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
Michael: This is where we first kissed.
Holly: I remember.
Michael: And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
Holly: Michael.. [they both laugh]
Michael: Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.
Holly: Yes.
Michael: In-grown hair.
Michael: Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?
Holly: Mh hmm.
Michael: We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
Holly: Oh, I say, I say, I say I sit on you!
Michael: And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
Michael: And over here..
Holly: What happened here?
Michael: Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]
Holly: Nice
Michael: Let's go in here.
Holly: [everyone in the office is standing in the kitchen with a lit candle] Hi guys.
Michael: This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Jim: Holly, will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Stanley: Marry me Holly.
Holly: No.
Michael: That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
Oscar: Will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Michael: That marriage would be a sham.
Gabe: Will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Michael: Easy no.
Angela: Will you marry me?
Holly: No.
Michael: That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
Ryan: Will you marry me Holly?
Holly: No.
Michael: Only one that I was kind of worried about.
Michael: [the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
Holly: Your wife becoming me will I. [everyone in the kitchen starts cheering, then enters annex]
Kevin: That's awesome!
Pam: Congratulations!
Jim: Congratulations!
Michael: Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
Kevin: All of us?
Michael: Yep.
Jim: Wait, what?
Michael: Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
Michael: Kahlua Sombrero, please.
Waiter: All right, so just you tonight?
Michael: Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Deangelo: I'll drink to that. I'm starting at a company this week.
Michael: Oh, really?
Deangelo: To begginings and endings.
Michael: And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
Deangelo: The moms and the troops.
Michael: Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
Deangelo: [laughs] I won't... I don't know her.
Michael: I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
Deangelo: Colorado! The sunshine state.
Michael: Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
Deangelo: Doing some skiing?
Michael: No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
Deangelo: Well that's just good sense right there. Everyone I know who skis is dead.
Michael: You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
Deangelo: Try it once, you're hooked. That's my guess.
Michael: That's what I've heard.
Deangelo: I'm an olympics nut.
Michael: Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
Deangelo/Michael: [in unison] Summer!
Deangelo: [holds out fist] Knuckles! Actually, I gotta come around and give you...
Deangelo: You know, it's funny, I tried to get an animal olympics going.
Michael: Really? What happened?
Deangelo: You know, life happened. What are you gonna miss most about Scranton?
Michael: Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Deangelo: That's the way it goes.
Michael: Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]
Deangelo: Excuse me. Hello? You running late?
Michael: No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.
Deangelo: I'm at the bar too.
Michael: You are? What bar?
Deangelo: I'm at the bar. The bar that's located in the lobby of the hotel.
Michael: I... do not see you.
Deangelo: How long have you...
Michael: I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
Deangelo: Ok, me too.
Deangelo/Michael: [looking up from phones in unison] Sorry...
Michael: What're you wearing?
Deangelo: I am wearing a grey suit, red tie.
Michael: Are we both at the right place?
Deangelo: Which place?
Michael: I hear your voice.
Deangelo: I hear your voice, I see your lips moving.
Michael: I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.
Deangelo: Deangelo Vickers.
Michael: Wow... that is insane! [laughter]
Deangelo: That is insane, that is the right term. Let's get some Vodka up in this cranberry, and one for my friend.
Michael: [entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?
Deangelo: I am ready.
Michael: Alright! Here we go!
Michael: This is it. What do you think?
Deangelo: Oh, she'll do. She'll do just fine.
Deangelo: I am very much looking forward to tommorow. It feels like the culmanation of a lot of hard work, a lot of good fortune...
Michael: [pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]
Deangelo: Did that? Did that just happen?! [runs after Michael] We should.. we should write a movie or something! I'm serious!
Oscar: Michael is leaving. And apparently they've already hired a new manager. And we're meeting him today. It's a lot to process. Paperwork wise.
Kevin: [wearing wig] Nope! It's not Ashton Kutcher. It's Kevin Malone! Equally handsome, equally smart! [winks]
Michael: Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!
Deangelo: [blinds roll down, Deangelo waving]
Michael: Come on out!
Deangelo: Hello! [opens door] How are you sir?
Michael: I am well, sir, how are you?
Deangelo: Can I just say, I am so excited to be working here. Little bit about myself, I love the American Southwest, for starters. You may call them Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, I call them heaven. I have a peanut allergy, something I live with, it's a part of me. I've learned to cope with it. What else, I'm just as comfortable at the ball game as I am at the opera. I was a-
Dwight: Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.
Kelly: [drops papers as Deangelo walks by] I'll get that you guys. Don't... it's just... you know...
Deangelo: [picks up paper] I'll help you.
Kelly: Oh, hi! [obviously flirting body language]
Deangelo: Hello!
Kelly: Have we met before?
Deangelo: No, not officially, actually, I saw you walking out of the bathroom before.
Kelly: Well, I guess I'll go back to my cave. It was really great meeting you.
Deangelo: [offers Kelly the papers as she walks away]
Kelly: And that is what you call a meet cute.
Michael: And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!
Darryl: Kind of embarassing.
Angela: Yeah, that story makes you sound stupid.
Michael: I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Deangelo: Oh. [chuckles] That was... let's see, where's my replacement? Where's the guy I'm replacing? Why don't I look to the left? He's sitting right there! [office laughs]
Michael: Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
Deangelo: [silences Michael]
Andy: That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.
Deangelo: [laughs] Office funny guy! Always glad to have an office funny guy around!
Andy: I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.
Michael: This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.
Pam: Well, it wasn't an affair.
Michael: Yes it was.
Pam: But, no, but we are a family.
Jim: [points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.
Pam: Cecelia.
Deangelo: Well, congratulations. I have four kids of my own.
Pam: Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]
Pam: Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!
Jim: Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
Dwight: Thanks for meeting me.
Michael: Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
Dwight: There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
Michael: You know me very well, Dwight.
Dwight: That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.
Michael: Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
Dwight: I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
Meredith: That apple looks delic!
Deangelo: I do a lot of portion control. I try to keep my daily calor intake under 1200. [laughter]
Stanley: Deangelo, you're going to starve to death. [laughter]
Michael: So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
Darryl: It's cool that you like the southwest. It's one of my favorite regions.
Darryl: It's one of my favorite regions? Did I just sound totally lame? No, I sounded good.
Darryl: I love the desert. It's one of my favorite ecosystems.
Deangelo: Here's the great thing about the southwest; there's so much more than desert. Along the north rim of the Grand Canyon is a forest as lush as you've ever seen.
Kevin: Burnt! It's lush, dummie. Hey, Deangelo, what do you think of bald people? I hate them.
Angela: Deangelo, I forget, did you mention you like politics?
Deangelo: I did not.
Angela: Cause I was thinking that you should meet my boyfriend, he's a state senator. I really think the two of you would hit it off. He's a great person to know.
Deangelo: Sounds very interesting, thank you.
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is Erin. Ok, let me transfer you.
Deangelo: Why do you use your name when you use the phone?
Erin: Oh, that's how Pam does it. I just copy her. She's sort of a living legend.
Deangelo: Try it without using your name.
Erin: Dunder Mifflin, this is... oh, I like it!
Deangelo: Dunder Mifflin, how may I assist you?
Erin: Oh, assist.
Michael: I sorta like the old way.
Deangelo: I just prefer it without the name and I thought- I've got to start doing some managing at some point.
Michael: I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
Deangelo: And it really isn't.
Michael: Is that good?
Erin: Yeah, ok, good.
Deangelo: Well, I'd like to change it, actually.
Michael: Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
Erin: What do you think?
Deangelo: I think a change would be nice.
Michael: You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings]
Denagelo: [whispering] Change it.
Erin: [picks up phone] ...I'm so sorry. Sorry. [hangs up]
Deangelo: Hey, funny guy. Wanna have a little mid-day lawl here. Make me laugh, huh? What you got? I can't even look at you.
Andy: Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter]
Erin: Deangelo, did you order a barber?
Deangelo: Oh, yeah. Put a pin on that, kid. Can't wait to hear the punchline.
Darryl: Finish the joke, Andy. What do African Americans call?
Andy: I... don't know. Help me.
Ryan: [a barber enters the office for Deangelo] That is so badass. So hardcore.
Phyllis: Yeah, real cool. Real power move.
Deangelo: I saw a hawk today. Just sitting right there on the overpass. Looking at me.
Michael: [to Erin] Shave me. [walks into office with Deangelo] This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
Deangelo: Ok, alright! I love it! I love it! Michael, this is Reggie. He is the #1 yelp reviewed shaver in Scranton. It's not even close.
Michael: And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck]
Deangelo: Alright. This is how we do it. Feels nice, doesn't it?
Michael: It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
Oscar: You wanted to talk to us Deangelo?
Deangelo: Ah, yes, please! Just cozy up there. Just thought we could have some rap sessions with smaller groups.
Michael: Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
Deangelo: Ok, then, powwows then, fine.
Michael: That's-
Pam: Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.
Jim: Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Pam: Da-das.
Jim: And what happens here is-
Deangelo: You know what, enough about your baby, ok? I'm sorry.
Jim: We were... I think she was just trying to-
Deangelo: No, no, no, I know what you're doing. Just quit it. I want to hear from the rank and file. How can I be the best manager for you all? What can I do better?
Michael: You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Oscar: Well, Deangelo, I'd say communication could be improved. People stopped reading memos, so everyone marks them urgent.
Michael: Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
Erin: Michael, can you stop talking now? I need to shave your lips.
Michael: Don't shave my lips.
Deangelo: [Andy walks into room] What's up?
Andy: I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...
Andy: I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.
Andy: ...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.
Deangelo: Let's not talk politics in the office, ok? I like you better as a funny guy.
Andy: [leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy]
Deangelo: [laughter] Now that's funny! That's funny! You walk much?
Andy: Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]
Deangelo: Little click...
Erin: [pushing box into office] Deangelo, this box came for you.
Deangelo: Thank you. That's my stuff. Yeah. Michael, take a look at this.
Stanley: Need a hand?
Deangelo: Oh, that'd be great, thank you Stanley!
Michael: You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
Ryan: [holds up painting of desert to office, who are impressed]
Michael: I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
Darryl: So this is a ten-gallon hat, huh?
Deangelo: Yep, ten-gallon hat. Technically, it only holds about three quartz. Little factoid.
Kevin: Interesting.
Michael: Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.
Darryl's sister: [holds out cowboy boots for Darryl]
Darryl: Cool, cool. Alright, see you later.
Darryl's sister: Hey, hey, hey! [holds up set of pistols in holsters]
Darryl: No, I'm good. Keep them.
Deangelo: Hey, funny man! Whatcha got for me? Make me laugh?
Andy: [mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]
Deangelo: [laughs] Drink some soap!
Andy: [drinks hand soap]
Deangelo: [laughter and applause]
Andy: I guess this is my life now.
Dwight: How do I become a manger at Sabre?
Gabe: First thing's first, thank you for coming here directly. I know you could have called Tallahassee but they would've just looped back to me, so, it's cool you recognized my role here.
Dwight: I left a message at corporate.
Gabe: Ahh. There you go. Get a recommendation from Michael. That'll put you right on the shortlist for next time there's an opening.
Dwight: Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
Gabe: What recommendation?
Dwight: From when he recommended me to replace him.
Gabe: ...I'm sorry, I never know how to act in these awkward-type situations.
Deangelo: Best whale watching: easily the west coast. If you're going whale watching on the East Coast, you might wanna bring a magazine called 'West Coast Whales'. [laughter] Because you're not gonna see them-
Michael: [interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
Kevin: Awesome!
Phyllis: Mmm, whatcha got?
Michael: PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]
Angela: Michael! Deangelo has a peanut allergy.
Deangelo: I need a wide berth. I need a wide berth from those nuts.
Stanley: What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?
Michael: I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go! [throws sandwitch into Kevin's open mouth]
Oscar: Michael, this is serious! Do you know what happens if Deangelo touches a peanut?
Michael: What?
Deangelo: Michael, the last time I was exposed to a peanut, I was itchy for three days, ok? I had to take baths constantly. I missed the O.J. verdict. I had to read about it in the paper like an idiot.
Jim: Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Deangelo: No, Jim, not everything is life or death. I want to feel comfortable.
Michael: Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]
Deangelo: [uses book to stop the sandwitch's flight] You're getting nut particles all in the air!
Michael: No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
Deangelo: [steps into conference room] Everyone, mandatory meeting. Multi-purpose room, now.
Michael: No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.
Oscar: Michael, This is insane.
Michael: No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
Jim: Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.
Michael: Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
Dwight: Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.
Deangelo: [walks out] Hold on, Hey Michael, Michael, wait up, hold on. Um, so for these meetings do you just jump into business or do you start with some chit-chat or...?
Michael: I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
Deangelo: Maybe. Maybe not. 50/50. You know what, it is too bad for this place that you're leaving. [extents hands for hug] Bring it in, come on. [Michael doesn't accept hug] Ok. [walks back]
Michael: Ok. [hugs Deangelo from behind] Why did you have to be so damn good?
Deangelo: I... I'm adequete. I'm half as good as you.
Michael: No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
Deangelo: Will you do me a favour and enjoy this time, ok? You've worked so hard, get your senioritis on. It's Lake Havasu time!
Micahel: Guess I've been working so hard I forgot what it's like to be hardly working.
Deangelo: Ok. What is the Native American girl's name?
Michael: You'll figure it out.
Jim: Hey, Deangelo! Wanna meet Cece?
Deangelo: That's a cute baby. Very cute baby. Adorable. Very cute.
Jim: Thank you very much.
Pam: See, we knew it! If he just met her, he'd understand.
Jim: We're back in! Right?
Deangelo: I swear, that baby could be the star of a show entitled 'Babys I Don't Care About.'
Pam: Hey Angela, you wanna see a picture of Phillip wearing those little booties you got us?
Angela: So cute.
Oscar: Hey, you guys want to see a picture of Gerald wearing galoshes? He refused to go out in the rain until I bought these. Now going out in the rain is all he wants to do.
Pam: Oscar thinks that having a dog is just like having a baby.
Angela: News flash - If you didn't carry it around for nine months, it isn't your kid.
Pam: Exactly. Unless you adopted, of course.
Angela: That is where we disagree.
Oscar: Hey, are your little dudes crawling yet?
Pam: No, three-month-old humans don't do that.
Angela: My Phillip is crawling.
Pam: Angela is such a liar!
Oscar: It's maddening!
Oscar: Exactly. That's just like crate training. All night long, all night long.
Pam: Well count yourself lucky. Wait until you have two. That's two sleep schedules, two naps that don't coincide, I mean, you'll never sleep again.
Angela: No one said 'you must have two'
Oscar: Like her genes are so important. The world just needs more Pam/Jim DNA. Thank you, no.
Angela: No thank you.
Andy: [laughing] Check this out. My brother just got a new sailboat. He has NO idea what he just got himself into. There's nothing harder than taking care of a boat'am i right?
Angela/Pam: Unbelievable!
Oscar: Un-be-liev-a-ble.
Nellie: It is the end of the day, it is the end of the week. We managed to fill 40 hours somehow. That's not bad, is it?
Packer: That's great.
Dwight: Pretty good.
Nellie: Well thank you. This is very helpful feedback. [Dwight raises his hand] Dwight, I am still not ready to name a VP.
Dwight: [laughing] That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
Nellie: I can't be hypnotized, Dwight. I tried it, I ended up smoking more.
Dwight: Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
Jim: Catching butterflies.
Dwight: That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
Jim: Theater.
Dwight: Waste of time.
Jim: Dragging.
Dwight: That's just a verb.
Jim: Dragging sticks.
Dwight: Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
Nellie: Alright, I'm gonna eliminate three people right now, okay? Just' you three, no.
Packer: Not good enough (clicks tongue)
Dwight: English peoples' main use today is judging American talent. [British accent] You're crap. You're wonderful. [back to American] They're mean, but they're incisive.
Nellie: Everyone meet in the hotel bar at 7:00. I'm not allowed to say it's mandatory, so let's just call it compulsory.
Packer: I'll be there at 6:00
Cathy: Ugh, we're gonna have one of those crazy nights, aren't we? Maybe we'll see the real 'Talla-nasty' we've been hearing so much about.
Jim: Talla-nasty', very clever.
Cathy: Thank you-
Gabe: Wait, wait, you think she invented 'Talla-nasty?' [chuckles] no, no, no, no'
Jim: Cathy? It's been great. Fun, normal. [in voiceover] I thought I was gonna be hanging out with stanley on this trip, but he's turned out to be kind of a loose cannon.
Stanley: My friend and I are new here in Tallahassee. Would you like to get a cocktail? [Jim slowly slinks down in his seat, with the 'Jim Face']. Maybe go out for a little dancing. Beautiful day, no?
Andy: Okay, everybody. 5:00. Workday is over. Put your pencils down. Aaannnnddd bring 'em back up, because now, the late night work jam begins!
Pam: Yes, the conference room is set up. I've got pens, I've got paper, I've got a whiteboard, we are good to go!
Andy: Say what?
Pam: We are good to goooo!
Andy: Say what?
Pam: We're good to goooo!
Angela: Stop it.
Andy: Say-
Angela: Stop it.
Oscar: Andy.
Andy: Tonight we're staying late to service the accounts of the people who went on the Florida trip.
Pam: Yes, of course, we could've just been doing this the whole time, but SOMEONE dropped the ball.
Andy: 'ball droppings can be beautiful. For example, when it turns an awkward soprano into a rich, full tenor.
Packer: Jason Bourne would kick Bond's ass.
Nellie: Jason Bourne has no support staff. His own government's out to get him.
Dwight: Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children ' What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Packer: Okay, drinking game. Count of three, take three sips.
Dwight: That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
Gabe: What happens if you're the hunchback?
Dwight: Oh, you get kicked.
Jim: How many buttons do you have?
Dwight: (takes out bag) 40. Always.
Cathy: Can I see?
Dwight: Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
Cathy: So, I get to kick you now.
Dwight: No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
Cathy: Well, that's how I played it in college.
Jim: College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
Dwight: Aah!
Packer: Aaaaand he host at his own lame game.
Nellie: Ooh, double meaning! The game was lame, and now he's lame from the kick. Quick wit.
Packer: Thank you.
Ryan: I'll have a glass of your oakiest chardonnay, please.
Erin: And I will have waffle with your mapliest syrup.
Waitress: Sorry, no waffles.
Erin: Oh, okay. Just forget it, then. Forget it. Forget it.
Ryan: A waffle?
Erin: A hotel waffle. I know what I want to eat. Is that crazy?
Ryan: No.
Erin: I'm moving down here, you know.
Ryan: Oh, no, I didn't know.
Erin: I'm young, and I can ' and if I can't, I'm still pretty young. I guess I'll always be young.
Ryan: You come with me. We're gonna get you that waffle.
Ryan: Why would Erin confide in me that she's staying here in Florida if she didn't want me to make some last-ditch, nothing to lose, Kelly Ka-who run at her? (Erin walks over) Hey.
Erin: Hey.
Pam: Watson carpet and tile.
Kevin: One order.
Oscar: Order reference number 00983-126.
Phyllis: Eight Cases, bright white inkjet.
Angela: Paid.
Kelly: I'm dying!
Darryl: Processed.
Val: And delivered.
Kelly: Sometimes I get so bored I just want to scream, and then sometimes I actually do scream. I just sorta feel out what the situation calls for.
Nellie: I will be right back.
Packer: I will be here.
Dwight: Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
Packer: Oh, please, You're through. She's going to give it to me as I'm giving it to her tonight. The cowgirl has chosen her saddle. [clicks tongue, whinnies]
Dwight: Well, saddles' [clicks tongue, whinnies] ' sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Packer: What? That's a joke, right? You see the way she's all over me.
Dwight: If anyone's having sex with Nellie for personal gain, it's me, and I'm not joking at all. If you don't tighten your saddle, you may fall off.
Andy: Who is ready for dinner? 'oh, I bet it's pizza, or tacos, or something stupid'. No. [claps] I went south of the border for this. And then I went south of that border. And we have ourselves' [takes foil off tray] [Jamaican accent] A Jamaican feast, mon!
Phyllis: If I wanted Jamaican food I'd just hire a bunch of bodyguards and go there.
Andy: Additional trivia factoid, this food comes to us through Val. And our server is none other than Brandon, her boyf!
Val: Hey.
Brandon: How you doing, Val? [Val and Brandon kiss]
Oscar: Jamaican, huh? I just read about the elections down there. Crazy stuff.
Brandon: Oh no, I'm not actually Jamaican.
Oscar: Terrific.
Darryl: What's up man? I'm Darryl.
Brandon: Darryl, I heard about you. You doing good?
Darryl: Oh yeah.
Brandon: Must be doing real good since you're f***ing my girlfriend.
Everyone: Whoa.
Kevin: Dude, you didn't tell me you were f***ing Val. High five!
Darryl: I'm not sleeping with your girlfriend.
Val: Brandon, what the hell are you talking about?
Brandon: Don't play dumb with me. I know what's up.
Val: Honey, I am not sleeping with-
Andy: Heyyy' let's get back to the food. Brandon, tell us about these delicious looking goops!
Brandon: Hope you all like goat.
Andy: Goat'
Nellie: Blow in my ear.
Packer: Alright.
Nellie: Like I'm on the beach.
Dwight: [imitates seagull calls] Seagull. [Continues seagull calls]
Nellie: And a wave crashing' a wave crashing.
Nellie: Oh, that is lovely.
Jim: Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Jim: Hey, how's it going?
Cathy: Hey, uh, good. Uh, the heating system though in my room is all messed up. It's like 90 degrees in there. Maintenance is working on it. Can I hang out here?
Jim: Uh' yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Cathy: Okay, yeah.
Jim: Okay.
Cathy: Cool' [Jumps onto bed] Is this March Madness? I love March Madness.
Jim: Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in' March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so' [sits on floor]
Cathy: LeBron James.
Jim: Yes, nice. Good word association
Cathy: [giggles]
Nellie: Impressive.
Dwight: Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it [puts string in his mouth]
Andy: Thornwood Wholesalers.
Kevin: One order.
Brandon: I read the text you sent to Val, man.
Val: That's messed up.
Angela: Is this spicy?
Brandon: No, baby girl. It would be messed up if I didn't find anything, but I did, so-
Andy: I'm pretty sure if Darryl sent Val a text, it was about some paper emergency or something.
Brandon: At midnight?
Andy: ' yeah'
Kevin: It happens! Like a hospital needs more napkins for surgery'
Kelly: Guys, we're not gonna settle anything this way. I think we just need to be grown-ups here.
Andy: Thank you.
Kelly: I thin we're gonna need to here those texts.
Andy: Kelly, remember how you wanted to go home before?
Kelly: No. There's no way in hell I'm leaving. Something interesting is happening here for once in my life, I am staying here. Darryl, read the texts.
Jim: Yup, coming. [opens door] All right.
Stanley: My mini bar is oddly out of rum.
Jim: We have plenty.
Stanley: Oh, hello. [laughs with Cathy]
Jim: Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
Stanley: Got it. Good night. Careful Jim, it gets easier and easier.
Jim: No, no, no, Stanley.
Stanley: mm-hmm. [about to leave]
Jim: Stanley. Stanley.
Stanley: uh-huh.
Jim: Stanley. Uhh' you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
Erin: Whoa. the lights are still on.
Ryan: Yeah, they keep them on 'cause it's less expensive than turning them on and off.
Erin: I like how guys just know stuff all the time.
Ryan: Girls know a lot of stuff too, okay? And nobody knows more than you. Especially me.
Erin: [gasps] Hello, waffle iron.
Ryan: Hello, what do we have here?
Erin: Okay, so the recipe says we need a mixing bowl'
Ryan: Right.
Erin: ' a measuring cup'
Ryan: Got that. [Metallic thud] Get down.
Erin: [whispers] It's the fuzz!
Ryan: [whispers] Shh! do you want us to get scolded? Shut your beautiful, beautiful mouth, please.
Darryl: I got too much ice cream. You want some?' 'Getting' my fry on.'
Kelly: Boring.
Darryl: Uh, 'The moon is huge tonight.'
Phyllis: Ooh, gosh, the moon one's damning. Yeah, sorry.
Darryl: That's regular text talk.
Brandon: You forgot one.
Darryl: You're such a great friend.'
Brandon: With the dots.
Darryl: You're such a great friend, dot dot dot dot dot.'
Kelly: Five dots, Darryl, are you kidding me? Okay, 'cause three dots means 'to be continued', four dots is a typo, but five dots means 'Whoa, do not make me say what I want to say, baby, but if I did, it would blow your mind, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
Everyone: Oh'
Brandon: See? Yes. Thank you, sister.
Val: Brandon, Darryl and me? That's ridiculous, right?
Darryl: Yeah, totally crazy. Puts me in an insane asylum just thinking about it. I'm stranded on shutter island over here.
Nellie: You look like Ed Harris if they stretched him a little bit.
Dwight: You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree? [cell phone rings] 'ahhmmm' excuse me' What?! Not now, I'm busy.
Jim: [on phone] I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Dwight: Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no' Freak, I need a favor.
Gabe: Well, then you have to call me by my name. Gabriel Susan Lewis.
Dwight: I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
Gabe: What's in it for GSL?
Dwight: You really want Packer as your boss?
Gabe: Got it.
Dwight: If Jim has bedbugs, that means they're everywhere. I can't risk them coming back to Schrute Farms. Our biggest attraction is our 200 year old mattresses.
Dwight: Where did you see it?
Jim: In the bed.
Cathy: I haven't seen anything.
Dwight: We gotta find it before it eggs. [pulls sheets off bed]
Cathy: Jeez'
Dwight: Describe it.
Jim: Brown, shiny, painful bite.
Dwight: Could be a bat weevil' Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
Jim: Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Dwight: Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Jim: So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Dwight: Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Jim: Yeah.
Dwight: Everything's a joke.
Jim: I know.
Dwight: Check your hair! [checks Jim's hair]
Jim: Ow.
Dwight: God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Jim: Just check it.
Dwight: You are clean. Okay' One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide [starts running in place and turning up the thermostat] I am going to generate myself into a human trap. [starts to take off clothes] When I jump into the bed, you are going to cover me with the sheet immediately. And then we'll see who's laughing. [dastardly laugh]
Jim: Alright.
Dwight: Yeah. [jumps into bed] Cover me!
Cathy: Is this really nessecary?
Jim: He knows what he's doing.
Dwight: Let the bedbugs bite!
Cathy: Ugh, god, I feel so gross. I have to go take a shower.
Jim: Alright, then I will catch you later' What do we do now?
Dwight: We wait. [Shower starts] Come to papa.
Jim: Oh.
Jim: I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Dwight: Nope, I wasn't bitten.
Jim: Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
Dwight: Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Jim: Come on.
Dwight: If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Jim: You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Dwight: No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
Jim: Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
Dwight: No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
Jim: Is that really how you want to get this job?
Dwight: Such a chorus girl.
Jim: Okay, Dwight' Dwight' Dwight, Dwight Dwight!' uh'
Cathy: [in a bathrobe] Is crazy gone?
Nellie: Oh!
Gabe: They don't make these cords in boot cut anymore!
Dwight: Euughh' Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present' Hey.
Cathy: Yeah, one death by chocolate, one bananas foster' Okay, cool. Thanks' I know, I'm a pig, right?
Jim: Hmm? No.
Cathy: [giggles] Wait, this why I exercise like a fiend. Feel. Seriously.
Jim: Okay alright. [gets up] I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
Cathy: Oh my God, what are you thinking?
Jim: um' I mean-
Cathy: I know that you're married, I sat at your wife's desk. How little do you think of me?
Jim: I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
Cathy: Can you' without running to the other side of the room all night?
Jim: Yes, I can. [Cathy laughs] uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just' we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
Cathy: Okay. [Sits next to Jim.] I am so cold.
Jim: [Jim Face]
Pam: Hey, Darryl. You okay?
Darryl: She's got a boyfriend.
Andy: Play it cool, man. She'll come around.
Pam: No, you should go for it. I mean nothing would've happened with me and Jim if he didn't put himself out there.
Andy: Yeah, but' My friend Jim would tell you to play it cool.
Pam: My husband would tell you to go for it.
Ryan: Hey.
Erin: Hey.
Ryan: Hey.
Erin: Hey.
Ryan: Hey, this is fun.
Erin: A lot of fun.
Ryan: I know. Can I give you a compliment? I'm really impressed by how much you've grown. Since I met you, it's like night and day.
Erin: You should move down here with me.
Ryan: Yeah?
Erin: We could be roommates.
Ryan: Really?
Erin: We could get a dog. We could go to R-rated movies. And who knows, I mean, you're a guy, I'm a girl-
Ryan: Yeah.
Erin: Maybe in six months-
Ryan: [louder] Six months?' um, okay, I'm in love with Kelly.
Nellie: Put your forehead near mine,  and see if you can read my thoughts.
Dwight: Okay' Seven, one, one, nine'
Nellie: No, no, no, not numbers, no.
Dwight: No, okay.
Nellie: No.
Dwight: Try again' Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one' is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
Nellie: Dwight, give me a key card to your room. Meet me in seven minutes for some one-on-one time.
Dwight: [gasps]Wait, the numbers!
Nellie: Mm-hmm.
Dwight: oh'
Nellie: mm-hmm'
Dwight: There you go.
Nellie: I will see you in seven-
Dwight: Seven minutes. [Dwight and Nellie kiss]' Nellie, wait. Let me write my room number on the card. [chuckles]. [Dwight writes on the key card scratches it with a magnet and hands it back to Nellie]
Dwight: [in voiceover] Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
Angela: 1434-967, paid.
Darryl: It has been processed.
Val: It has been delivered.
Pam: That's it, last one.
Kelly: Andy this has been an amazing night. Epic.
Andy: Cool-down fiesta begins right now. I got decaf coffee'
Phyllis: No way.
Andy: I got Romy and Michele's High School Reunion'
Val: Hey. I just wanted to apologize. I mean, that was so weird. Can we just, like, never talk about it again?
Darryl: Sure.
Val: Okay, thanks.
Darryl: Hey, just so you know, me and you' I don't think that's ridiculous' Dot, dot, dot' dot, dot.
Jim: All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Cathy: What? Oh, Jim, I thought we talked about this. You're cool, right?
Jim: Cathy, go.
Dwight: [wearing face mask with spray chemicals in hand] Where's the bug?
Jim: Awesome.
Dwight: [sprays the bed and Cathy] Stand back!
Cathy: Aah! Stop, it, oh my god! That burns! what is that?!
Dwight: [continues spraying the bed] It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Cathy: [coughs and moans]
Jim: Right there! [points to Cathy]
Cathy: Oh stop it, stop it, stop it!
Jim: [coughs] Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
Cathy: I can't breathe!
Dwight: I think I saw it!
Cathy: Stop it! [runs out the door]
Jim: Nice job, I think you got 'em.
Dwight: You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
Jim: [Jim face]
Dwight: Second best Bananas Foster I've ever had.
Jim: Oh yeah? What's the first best?
Nellie: [at the door, unsuccessfully trying to open it with the demagnetized key card] Dwight? [knocks] Hello? Dwight?
Jim: [whispers] Is that Nellie?
Dwight: [whispers] Don't let-shh!
Nellie: Are you in there? I can see the light on under your door. Hello? [knocks] [Dwight turns off the lights] Oh, look at that. The light went off, just as I said the light went on. Hello? [knocks] Dwight? [whispers] Dwight. [Dwight eats his Bananas Foster]
Dwight: Today is the test launch day for the inaugural Sabre store. Brr brr brr BRR [imitating trumpet] and I, Dwight Schrute, am in charge of the entire operation. If I can prove myself today and the store is a hit with the media and Nellie sees this, the vice presidency is mine.
Ryan: Are you holding this chair?
Dwight: Yes.
Ryan: 'cause I feel like I'm gonna fall off.
Dwight: Yes. Yes.
Ryan: I'm not wearing the right shoes for this.
Dwight: We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Erin: Hey Strangers. So stoked for the Sabre store opening.
Erin: Hey, my name's Tabitha. I'm camped out in front of the Sabre store so I can be first in line for the new Pyramid. Psst. It's me Erin. Dwight had me pretend to be a hipster to create hype, and it's working. There's already people camped out behind me.
Nellie: Test launch day, people. Now, I would like to fill you in on a little secret about me to inspire you today. Now, I know you probably all think I'm this patrician goddess. But here's the truth. I was born in the little working class town of Basildon, and until the age of 32, [cockney accent] I talked like this, which was bloody horrendous, innit? I came from dirt, no lower than ' what's lower than dirt?
Dwight: Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Nellie: Yeah, thank you. Loam. Bloody loam, I came from. I hit rock bottom when I auditioned for the Spice Girls. I didn't even get a callback.
Jim: Which Spice Girl?
Nellie: The black one. I never stood a chance.
Jim: Okay.
Nellie: Now, think about my journey here today, and let it inspire your journey.
Dwight: Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.
Todd Packer: Yep
Dwight: Today is press day and press is gonna make or break this store. And for a tech company, press can only mean one thing ' bloggers. Dossier on bloggers. Bloggers are gross. Bloggers are obese. Bloggers have halitosis. You're gonna love 'em. Ryan is going to be the main event today. He is the pitchman who is going to give the feisty yet profound speech worthy of a world's fair. Ryan, you ready to do this?
Ryan: When people see this presentation, they're gonna [bleep] in their pants.
Dwight: Okay.
Jim: Come on, man.
Cathy: Seriously disgusting.
Dwight: Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Cathy: Ugh. Kill me. That was my idea.
Dwight: Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
Todd Packer: Uh'
Nellie: Uh' that is excellent.
Todd Packer: I don't see what that gets us, but I'm a team player.
Dwight: Perfect casting, right?
Todd Packer: Schrute's out to get me. But I'm playing the long game. As soon as he messes up, I swoop in like a sexual predator.
Nellie: I want to create a sense of wonder and enthusiasm as if, at the end of E.T., candy poured out of the screen. Do you understand? I wanna get goose pimples.
Dwight: Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!
Andy: Morning, everyone.
Kevin: Oh, Andy, guess what happened to me this morning?
Andy: Don't care. Tell me later.
Kevin: Listen, it's important. You've gotta hear this.
Andy: What do you got?
Kelly: Oh, my god!
Phyllis: Do you have a black eye?
Andy: Yes, I do. Phyllis.
Kevin: I woke up at 4 am by accident in time for the paper to be delivered. Guess what?
Andy: What?
Kevin: It's not a kid on a bike. It's a man in a car.
Darryl: Andy, who punched you?
Meredith: Hey, I was on the can. What's this about a black guy in the office?
Angela: Black eye, Meredith.
Kelly: Will someone please explain what's going on here? Since the interesting thing happened til now, so much time has passed, it's like my life is buffering.
Andy: Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam'
Pam: That's true.
Andy: They had, uh' weapons.
Pam: Weapons.
Andy: I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.
Pam: But these were not the kind of people who use their words.
Andy: Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.
Pam: Thank goodness he was there.
Oscar: Good job Andy.
Kevin: Yeah [all murmuring]
Andy: I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.
Dwight: Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!
Man: Quit it.
Dwight: There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Erin: I was ahead of you!
Dwight: Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids.
Erin: Come on. I was in line before you.
Cathy: So you're a blogger right?
Blogger: Yeah. Blogger.
Cathy: God, stay away. Oh, I always get in trouble around bloggers. I'm trying to be a good girl for once.
Erin: Uh yeah. I already bought my Pyramid, but I don't want to leave yet. I haven't had so much fun since seeing' zoo-Ey Desh-channel at the Couch-arilla music festival. So fun.
Oscar: How can we feel safe knowing that there are gangs here? We should call the police right now!
Andy: No.
Angela: Yes.
Andy: No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?
Pam: Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.
Andy: And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.
Angela: Why would you care what the police think of our neighborhood?
Andy: Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.
Pam: 1-8-5-0-5.
Darryl: Guys, guys. That's so vague. You gotta do the zip plus four. 1-8-5-0-5 dash 7-4-2-7.
Phyllis: Look, I don't feel safe. I think we should call the police.
Angela: Yes.
Andy: Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why' Toby is giving us self defense training.
Toby: Me?
Andy: Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?
Toby: Yeah, um... I can't believe you remembered. I do self-defense. Um, I'll go put on my cup.
Andy: Great.
Nellie: Yes!
Blogger: Okay.
Nellie: I wasn't really sure which one of you is Chuck.
Jim: [on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Blogger: Look at that guy. He's got his Sabre phone on, and he's not even using it.
Blogger 2: This is a perfect photo for my Daily Fail blog.
Jim: Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
Nellie: Dwight, what is a fail? That sounds bad.
Dwight: Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing.
Dwight: Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?
Jim: I'm very sorry.
Nellie: We gave you an Arrowhead for free for the day. How hard would it have been to do this, hmmm? 'Hello. Hi sweetie. It's Jim. I'm calling you from the new Arrowhead, which is why my voice is crystal clear. And my hand will never get tired because of the ergonomic shape.'
Jim: I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Dwight: You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ��Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Dwight: Point it towards the store, idiot!
Dwight: [laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.
Dwight: Oh hey, Hey, hey, you guys, you must be lost. Listen. Excuse me, sir. Yeah, the fountain where you can feed the pigeons is out behind the bank. Tell your great-grandson to bring his kid by. Okay. So long. Here we go. Erin! Psst! Come on! The elderly suck the life out of the young. Get them out of here!
Erin: We are closed! Come on.
Toby: Self-defense is not some fun boxing match, okay? This is about escaping with your life. So... strike, scream, and run. All right? Let's try it.
Creed: [smacks Meredith's head] [screams] [runs out]
Meredith: Ow.
Toby: That may have been my fault.
Meredith: What the hell, Toby?
Toby: Okay, look, in a real crisis situation, you're not gonna have to time to think, okay? So just remember, I-A-A-T-G. 'It's all about the groin.'
Andy: What if you're being attacked by a ' smallish man who happens to not have a groin?
Toby: I don't think that's very common.
Andy: What if you're being attacked by a 4'11' man who is penisless?
Oscar: Why are you fixated on this hypothetical transgendered attacker?
Andy: Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.
Toby: Well, the most common scenario is a larger man attacking a smaller female.
Andy: So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?
Toby: It's interesting that you're drawn to the point of view of the attacker. ��You would like the turn of the table. Okay, the latest Chad Flenderman novel... [everyone groans] written from the point of view of his nemesis, Dr. Lucifer Wu.
Angela: Can I please leave? I have a rape flute.
Toby: All right, well, let's try one simple technique together. Okay, why doesn't everyone stand? Okay, so... you're being attacked. You've got your hands up. Simple palm strike to the chin. Up to the chin. One, two.
Everyone: One, two.
Andy: [softly] Take that, kid.
Dwight: Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.
Lady Blogger: Patty Grossman. I'm a woman.
Dwight: But you still work for Wired, right?
Patty: Yes.
Dwight: Good! Okay. Flirt away.
Ryan: Sabre. It's time to come home.
Jim: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Ryan: Yeah, no [bleep], Sherlock! Can somebody please tell me something encouraging about this presentation before I go out there in front of a million people and do it?
Dwight: Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
Ryan: You know what?
Dwight: You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
Jim: Dwight.
Dwight: I'm trying to make him feel important.
Ryan: God. I wish Kelly were here. She always knew what to say.
Dwight: Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.
Ryan: You're so ignorant. You barely know what you're talking about. That is so ridiculous. You really need to read a couple books.
Dwight: What's a book? [giggles]
Ryan: On my God. You're so embarrassing. ��My mom would say the best stuff, though.
Jim: [ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.
Ryan: And you know that I'm capable of this.
Jim: You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.
Ryan: What did you think of the presentation?
Jim: I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Ryan: Oh! 'Fix' means you hate it! I knew it! I need something to drink!
Dwight: Jim, get him a water.
Ryan: No, not a water. A sports drink. I hate everything in that fridge. Not red! Get me something yellow or green from a nearby store. Not red!
Dwight: Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!
Toby: Now, if your attacker is willing to defile a corpse, you better stop playing dead right away and just make it known that you're alive.
Lady: Forgive me for interrupting. I believe my daughter had an altercation with somebody here, some fancy gentleman with a squeaky voice?
Andy: [deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.
Girl: That's him... the guy I hit.
Darryl: What?
Oscar: You've gotta be kidding me.
Kevin: Poor Andy! First you got beat up by a gang, and now she kicks your ass?
Oscar: No, Kevin -- [sighs]
Lady: What about the lady you hit with the pine cone?
Girl: There. That chubby one.
Pam: I just had a baby.
Girl: Yesterday?
Pam: Wow.
Lady: Apologize.
Girl: Sorry I kicked your ass in front of your 'thin' girlfriend.
Pam: How 'bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?
Lady: You know what? Tiffy's going to college.
Andy: [deep voice] Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.
Lady: God bless. Friend of mine uses your paper. You do good work. Bye bye.
Kevin: Bye.
Kelly: So, Toby, I think we should do a different self-defense seminar -- 'How to protect ourselves against tiny little girls.'
Toby: There's no shame in getting beaten up by a girl. My ex-wife used to demolish me.
Kelly: No, there is shame in it, okay? We have to draw the line somewhere.
Darryl: Oh my God, I think I see the imprint of a ring pop.
Andy: Oh... [Kelly laughing]
Dwight: Have you seen Erin?
Stanley: I'm on break.
Dwight: Oh God... ��Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.
Blogger: When's the presentation?
Dwight: It's moments away. Just stay here!
Ryan: [on phone] Hey Uncle Lucas, it's your nephew Ryan. Honestly, I could use a prescription for ritalin right now. Well, I know you did one for Aunt Carol. Oh, so it's different because it's your wife? ��Well, that doesn't make any sense to me.
Nellie: How you doing?
Ryan: Don't talk to me right now. I'm sorry. I- I know you're my boss, but seriously, you need to get the hell out of my face. What I don't understand is... [voice fades]
Nellie: [to Dwight] Your little man is unraveling. Now go and fix it.
Erin: Sorry about kicking you out. It's just, we don't want our brand associated with death.
Old Lady: It's okay. I'll go to the Costco and search for handsome men.
Erin: You're not married yet?
Old Lady: [laughs] Oh, I was. My husband was my best friend. He passed away.
Erin: My best friend was my boss, Andy. We dated for a while, but since then, he rejected me, and we're not really friends.
Old Lady: Someone rejected you? With that body and those bazongas? Forget him!
Erin: Yeah! Forget him! And you should forget your husband.
Old Lady: Well...
Dwight: How long has he been in the bathroom?
Jim: About ten minutes.
Dwight: Jeez! What's he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates]
Jim: Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
Dwight: Are there any bloggers around?
Jim: It's Ryan. 'I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home.'
Nellie: What is the delay here? Where's Ryan? Why is he not here?
Dwight: I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!
Jim: Uh...
Nellie: What?
Dwight: That's right. Will you just give us a second?
Nellie: You are gonna bloody ruin it. You're gonna bloody ruin it because you're a no-good half-assed cock-eyed...
Jim: okay.
Nellie: That's....
Dwight: Jim --
Jim: I'm not doing the Presentation.
Dwight: Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, [whispers] I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim.
Jim: Okay, I'll do it.
Dwight: Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes.
Jim: A costume?
Dwight: Of course there's a costume! [laughs] ��Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Dwight: Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?
Jim: I've been in here for 20 seconds.
Dwight: Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?
Jim: I'm not wearing eyeliner.
Dwight: You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
Jim: Time. Space. Gender. [Dwight mouthing words] There are no rules anymore. All boundaries are breaking down in the wake of the infinite future. The only thing that -- the only thing that remain -- the only thing that remains are the things that have stood the test of time -- love, values, and of course, the pyramids -- the strongest shape ever constructed, a shape that fits all other shapes inside of it. [softly] No, that's --
Dwight: It's true.
Jim: This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]
Dwight: Yep.
Jim: When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. ��I just wanted... to go home. ��This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. ��You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space.
Crowd: ahhhhhh
Dwight: Psst.
Jim: Oh.
Ryan: [image on Pyramid] Sabre... It's time... to come home.
Crowd: [applause]
Jim: All right. ��Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues]
Jim: Yeah. ��Thank you. Thank you.
Toby: Okay, this isn't over. Let's stay focused, okay? ��We made fun of Andy earlier for getting beat up by a little girl, but... little things can be dangerous.
Kevin: Whether it's a gremlin or chucky the doll. The key is to throw it in something. Like a fireplace, or a tub of electricity.
Toby: Okay. Good point...
Angela: Good point? What is a tub of electricity?
Toby: I don't... I don't...
Oscar: With all due respect we know what we're defending against: a twelve year old female bully.
Kelly: I was a twelve year old bully.
Angela: Great! I think Kelly should attack Toby.
Others: Yeah.
Kelly: Yeah, that's not a bad idea, actually, because I have had a lot of pent up aggression.
Angela: Thanks.
Kelly: Good. Let's go.
Toby: I don't know if this is gonna help...Uh...
Angela: Let's go Kelly.
Toby: We should stay to maybe some more traditional models...
Kelly: You think you're so pretty! ��Well you're not gonna be so pretty come Prom time!
Toby: Okay, this is what's called pre-violent posturing.
Kelly: Take that! ��Not so pre-violent anymore!
Toby: Okay, I'm at what's called 'the decision point.'
Andy: Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!
Pam: [laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.
Andy: You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ��I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, 'Where were you when the girls came?'
Andy: Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ��I just feel good!
Dwight: Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ��We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.
Nellie: Dwight. ��You're the vice president.
Dwight: Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!
Nellie: [squealing]
Dwight: Okay! Come on!
Nellie: aagh!
Dwight: Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!
Andy: [exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.
Everyone: [gasps] What?! Why is that?
Andy: He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.
Angela: So, he's alive.
Andy: Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.
Angela: Well, the way you said it made it sound like he was dead.
Andy: How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.
Phyllis: If Dwight's not coming back, does that mean we can open his treasure?
Oscar: You guys, we've gone over this, there is no treasure. [Erin retrieves the 'treasure box' and slams it down on Dwight's desk]
Oscar: When the team left for Tallahassee, Dwight told everyone not to touch his treasure. [cut to Dwight holding treasure chest and telling the office 'Don't touch my treasure. Ok, you understand?'] Obviously he wants us to obsess about it. There's nothing in there. [has realization] Which is obviously what he would want us to think, making it the perfect place to hide a treasure. Oh god, I'm Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride.
Andy: I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees]
Oscar: I am dying to know what's in there.
Andy: Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]
Creed: Hi, hello.
Andy: [to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.
Creed: [opens box, pulls out and displays contents] It's a photo of all of us.
Pam: Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]
Dwight: [feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!
Dwight: [on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]
Nellie: Oh, all right! Well swung my VIP VP.
Robert California: I am loving the chemistry between you two.
Nellie: I am so happy Dwight is gonna be working alongside me. We are a regular Archibald and his man George.
Robert California: I bet. I'm excited.
Nellie: Trick... there's no such thing. It's not even a real English duo.
Dwight: Ah!
Nellie: I just made you look like the goat of Dover. And that doesn't exist either.
Dwight: [to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh]
Jim: Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]
Dwight: [sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!
Nellie: He doesn't even care.
Dwight: Don't even care!
Jim: This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.
Darryl: [entering Andy's office] Hey, man. Selling cookies for Jada. Want the same as last year?
Andy: Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.
Darryl: I'll put you down for shortbreads.
Andy: Damn it.
Toby: [entering Andy's office] Knock, knock. Hey, Sasha's first year in the troops, so I'm selling cookies for her. Anyway, would you like some?
Darryl: No. No.
Toby: What?
Darryl: I been selling here for five years. This is my spot.
Toby: You can't claim territories. This is the only place I interact with people. Can't you sell at your church or barber shop? [Darryl looks hurt] Or chess club, or?
Darryl: You know what? It's your first time, let's split the office. You can have sales, the annex, Creed, and I don't know I'll just take, uh, accounting.
Toby: That's it? Yeah, well, ok. Thanks Darryl.
Darryl: OK, great.
Darryl: [exits Andy's office smiling] All I need is Kevin. Dude buys more cookies than everyone combined and then some. [Kevin waves at him] When I first started selling cookies he was a relatively thin man. Not a thin man, mind you. Relatively thin.
Erin: [entering a home carrying groceries] Hellosi, I'm home, babaloo.
Elderly Woman: [rises from chair] Oh, here let me help.
Erin: [spilling groceries] I got it. It was so busy at the store today. Really good cheese samples. I had, like, a hundred.
Erin: Irene hired me as her live-in helper. We met at the store launch. I told her I was moving here and I needed a place and it just sort of made sense. I basically do everything for her. [Erin randomly adds an assortment of pills to a weekly pill box] I run errands. I do chores around the house. I cook and clean. Honestly, I don't know how she survived without me.
Irene: When can I introduce you to my grandson? He's a wonderful swimmer. Shallow end, deep end. He does it all.
Erin: Well, today might be kind of tough, Irene. I have to talk to my old boss, Andy, and tell him I'm staying in Florida. [hands Irene a mug]
Irene: [takes mug] Thank you. [takes a sip] Oh, what kind of tea is this?
Erin: Oh, I boiled some Gatorade.
Nellie: [misses putt] Ah. In England, they put the holes a little bit to the right, you see. We'll just chalk it up to cultural bias.
Robert California: If I may, [assists Nellie] try holding the putter... yeah, with your wrists here. And your thumbs here.
Nellie: Oh.
Robert California: That's right. Your little finger.
Darryl: [approaches Kevin] Would you like to buy some cookies?
Kevin: Cookies, eh?
Kevin: [singing] Oh, the springtime thinks that it's the best. And fall time thinks that it's the best. Cold time has, kind of a strut. And Valentine's thinks that it's the best. But gather round, peeps, I'll tell you the truth. Nothing beats the cookie season, that's the truth.
Darryl: [Kevin scratches cookie order form and sniffs it] It's not a scratch-and-sniff, Kev.
Kevin: I know. But sometimes you still get a little something.
Toby: [to Darryl] Hey, you tricked me. You just wanted Kevin.
Darryl: You're new to the game. You learned a lesson today. See you next year, sport.
Toby: No, no, no. It's not fair. What if Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?
Kevin: I do.
Toby: See?
Darryl: That doesn't mean anything. [to Kevin] Kevin, do you want to buy cookies from me?
Kevin: Oh, I definitely do.
Darryl: [to Toby] Huh. Hit the road, jack.
Toby: No, you hit the road, jack.
Kevin: [looking pleased] Hey guys, come on. Don't fight over me.
Toby: You know, why don't we split the order? It's only fair.
Kevin: No. Wait, no. I'm buying, I make the rules. I actually do want you to fight over me. I wanna be wined and dined and... 69ed.
Angela: Ugh.
Kevin: Metaphorically 69ed. Ew. Perverts... no offence Oscar. [Oscar looks flabbergasted]
Nellie: Hop in, we have places to be. No rest for the wicked.
Jim: [to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.
Dwight: Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.
Jim: [attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.
Dwight: [drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]
Jim: Well, he's Florida's problem now.
Robert California: I'll let Dwight have his fun. Today will not be his day.
Jim: What's that?
Robert California: I'm gonna tank the Sabre store at the presentation to the board.
Jim: I thought you liked the store?
Robert California: Well, the store is lovely. You created a wonderful space to showcase our product line. Great job. Cheers.
Jim: Thank you.
Robert California: But, there's a reason we sell our products online and over-the-phone. Have you ever used Sabre electronics, Jim? [Jim shakes head] They're cheap. They're unintuitive. The Sabre store would work if we adopted the carnival model of leaving town once everyone's wives do us.
Jim: Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.
Robert California: I couldn't just kill the project from the start. Jo Bennett endorsed it. Shame though, I did like Dwight.
Dwight: [from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!
Robert California: [to Dwight] Bravo, Dwight! Very good! [Jim looks surprised] [to Jim] Shame.
Dwight: [at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.
Nellie: How did that look?
Gabe: I'm not just saying this, that was the best thing I've ever seen.
Dwight: [to Nellie] I told you.
Todd Packer: When you guys do that whole power of two shebang, how 'bout I pop up also? I guess we'd have to say 'power of three'. Hm, actually, you know what, yeah, that actually works. [to Nellie] You'd spin off right. I'd spin off-
Dwight: You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.
Jim: [enters room] All right. There he is.
Dwight: What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
Jim: Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
Dwight: What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]
Jim: Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]
Dwight: You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]
Todd Packer: Nice. [To Jim] Hey, Halpert, anyone ever tell you you look like Wooly Willy?
Dwight: [to Packer] Silence.
Todd Packer: Aw, I'm just trying to-
Dwight: [interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.
Todd Packer: That's... that's the same guy. It's the joke I made.
Dwight: Different guy.
Jim: You know, I just think you should know that-
Dwight: [interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh]
Jim: Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.
Erin: Can you help me? I'm trying to make a video chat with Andy.
Irene: Just open the program and type in his user name.
Erin: Can you just do it?
Irene: [after briefly typing] Here, type in your password.
Erin: Erin123'
Irene: That's a terrible password. And you don't 'make a video chat', you video chat.
Erin: [annoyed] All right.
Andy: [video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?
Erin: That's so weird. There's something wrong with my laptop. [turns laptop on its side] Oh. I fixed it.
Andy: Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.
Pam: [on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.
Jim: No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Pam: Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.
Jim: I tried. He will not listen.
Pam: Did you actually try your hardest?
Jim: Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
Stanley: Don't talk to me.
Jim: Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Pam: If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.
Jim: OK. All right.
Darryl: [to Kevin] What's a skinny guy like Toby know about cookies? You can't trust him to understand the wants and needs of the thick man. Maybe Toby from two years ago.
Phyllis: [laughs] Yeah.
Kevin: That's true. If I have a question about my cookies at midnight, who am I gonna call? Darryl. Toby's probably in bed with some model.
Darryl: Thank you.
Toby: I'm, I'm not gonna comment on my personal life.
Darryl: Look, I need this. Ok? Your daughter is a pretty little girl. Let her go door-to-door. You think people gonna buy cookies from my [hesitates] chubby daughter?
Phyllis: Oh. [looks away]
Darryl: Baby, if you're watching this, you're not chubby, you're beautiful. Daddy's just got to sell some cookies. And we're also gonna exercise more. It's gonna be fun.
Kelly: [to Kevin] Oh, you know what you have to do? To decide? You need to make them do things for you. And, like, buy you things.
Pam: Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.
Phyllis: Make them kiss each other.
Meredith: Make them kiss me. [everyone 'ew's] [Toby and Darryl look at each other]
Erin: Yes, this is too tan. This right here-
Andy: No.
Erin: This is a tanned spot.
Andy: I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.
Erin: Well, Andy, I'm not coming back.
Andy: What?
Erin: I have a job here. I work for an old lady. [turns laptop to put Irene into view]
Irene: [waves] Hello!
Erin: Andy?
Andy: Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.
Kevin: [Toby and Darryl perform Hello! Ma Baby] This is tough. 'Cause Darryl, you sang better and you dance better but Toby has that indescribable quality that makes a star. I think I've reached my decision. I have decided... that you guys are gonna keep doing things for me.
Darryl: No, no, no, no. It's not worth it.
Toby: No.
Kevin: No, it's not worth it? That's too bad. 'Cause I was feeling particularly hungry this year.
Darryl: Yeah, ok so what, you buy 40 boxes?
Kevin: Hungrier.
Toby: 50?
Kevin: Hungrier.
Darryl: You're not talking... triple digits?
Kevin: Oh yeah, I'm talking triple digits. [folds arms satisfied while Toby and Darryl look at each other] Again. [both start performing Hello! Ma Baby again]
Dwight: [straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.
Jim: [enters abruptly] Dwight.
Dwight: You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
Jim: OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?
Dwight: Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?
Jim: Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.
Dwight: [rolls eyes] Jim, come on.
Jim: Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
Dwight: Uh-huh.
Jim: And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.
Dwight: Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?
Jim: Yes.
Dwight: [smiles] That's two things.
Jim: Dwight, please.
Dwight: Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
Jim: OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
Dwight: You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Jim: Dwight, come o-
Dwight: Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]
Dwight: [Jim holds him back and tries to cover his mouth] Help! Help!
Jim: Gross! Don't lick my hand! God, why is there so much saliva?
Dwight: AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.
Jim: Gross!
Dwight: [attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!
Jim: What? What, what, what, what, what?
Dwight: [clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
Jim: I'm sorry.
Dwight: My wound hasn't healed yet.
Jim: I'm so sorry, I forgot.
Dwight: Oh, man!
Jim: You all right? You ok?
Dwight: [stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!
Nellie: [to Cathy] Where the hell is he? I cannot do this without him.
Cathy: I don't know. He's not picking up.
Todd Packer: Well, looks like Shnoot's a no-show. Guess he wasn't vice presy material after all. But I am. Put me in, babe. I got the info down backwards, forwards, and doggy-style. I'm your man.
Nellie: [considers and decides on Packer] Right, let's begin then. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce the vice president of Sabre Retail, Mr. Todd Packer.
Todd Packer: Sup?
Phyllis: [notices Andy boxing up things from Erin's desk] What are you doing?
Andy: I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.
Oscar: We knew. Ryan told us.
Andy: Ryan, why didn't you tell me?
Ryan: Thought you checker my Tumblr?
Andy: You never update it.
Ryan: Well, I updated it.
Andy: Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?
Pam: We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]
Dwight: [trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]
Jim: What are you doing?
Dwight: I was trying to go-
Jim: Get up.
Dwight: Ok, ok.
Jim: Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
Dwight: Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
Jim: OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
Dwight: [tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans]
Kevin: [holding mobile phone up] Go.
Darryl: [in a feminine voice] Hi. This is Alex.
Toby: [in feminine voice] And this is Sam.
Darryl: [in a feminine voice] Kevin can't come to the phone right now because he's busy with us.
Kevin: Perfect! Now people will think I'm doing hot girls all day.
Darryl: I don't know, man, they might think we're drag queens.
Toby: Yeah, I don't know why you picked names that are also guys' names.
Kevin: Okay, now who do I ride to the kitchen like a pony?
Toby: Don't make me be your pony, Kevin.
Darryl: Forget it, man.
Kevin: What do you mean?
Darryl: I'm out. And so is Toby.
Darryl: This may be wrong. But there's a limit to what I would do for my child.
Toby: Yeah. I have my dignity too. I refuse to be another man's horsey.
Kevin: No guys, stop! You have to sell me cookies. I'll do anything. [starts performing Hello! Ma Baby] I'm even gonna kiss Meredith. [kisses Meredith] That is... hmph... that's ah... so good. [almost in tears Meredith pulls him toward her by his tie]
Jim: [tackled by Dwight] What are you doing? No. No, no, no.
Dwight: This. Ends. Now.
Jim: This is dangerous.
Dwight: [picks Jim up] Rrahh! [both fall]
Jim: Why?
Dwight: Anything else you need to talk about?
Jim: Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away]
Dwight: [looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.
Robert California: What baffles me is how you could take a perfectly good idea, [Dwight enters] which the great Jo Bennett rightfully signed off on, and then utterly botch it in execution.
Todd Packer: If I may speak to that, I have only been vice president of this project for the last half hour, so the man you want is Dwight Shrute.
Robert California: I don't see Dwight. He clearly had the infinite wisdom to stay as far away from this clown show as possible.
Nellie: Whatever you do, do not blame Todd Packer. It is not his fault. Blame his upbringing, his parents, the society that would mold this idiotic creature. Fire the employee, yes... but not the man. You may not cancel his soul.
Robert California: That was never on the table.
Todd Packer: [to Nellie] Are you kidding? [to Robert] She's the queen of the whole freaking Magilla!
Robert California: And yet Todd, it's you who's fired.
Todd Packer: What, you, I, I can't get fired. I'm an institution. I have been at this company for 20 years. How many of you have been here that long, huh? [Dwight exits meeting room and helps Jim up]
Darryl: [Dwight and Jim enter office] Hey, hey. They're back. [Everyone greets them]
Kelly: Dwight, what are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be in Florida?
Jim: Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
Kelly: Thank you, for someone who actually notices this. No, I didn't lose weight. But I started using my makeup to contour my face to look skinnier. I actually put on five pounds.
Phyllis: [to Stanley] Hey! Good to have you back.
Stanley: [insincerely] Good to be back.
Pam: [to Jim] Hey, stranger!
Jim: Hey.
Pam: Aw, I missed you.
Jim: I missed you. [they embrace and kiss as Andy watches on sadly]
Pam: Aw.
Andy: I'm going to Florida to get Erin. [grabs coat, runs out, then returns] Forgot to turn off my email. It's crazy, right? It's just, when she said she was leaving, I felt so- [looks at computer frustrated] 'You're about to close four tabs, are you sure you want to continue?' Yes. I am sure. Ah, slow computer!
Pam: [telephone ringing] This is Pam. Oh my God, are you sure? Uh, okay. Okay, um, we'll be right there. Everybody, the balloon is falling.
Kevin: Nice.
Pam: There's this balloon that has been floating in the rafters of the warehouse for, like, ever. And, okay, it's not -- it doesn't sound cool. You just have to see it.
Pam: Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal.
Jim: Wow. It's the end of an era.
Pam: Did a good job, Buddy. Now it's time to come home.
Oscar: I remember when that balloon went up there. I was still with Gil. We were so happy.
Kevin: When that went up there, I had hair like Rapunzel.
Ryan: How long do you think it's been up there, Kevin?
Kevin: I just remember pushing aside my silky bangs to say, 'Look, a balloon.'
Dwight: My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
Meredith: My kid didn't have a face tattoo.
Darryl: I was still thinking of going back to school.
Jim: And I was still just a paper salesman.
Dwight: Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here. [everyone sighs]
All: Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. Kill the balloon. [pops loudly] [cheers and applause]
Jim: Hey. So they accidentally gave us an extra egg sandwich this morning. Who wants it?
Kevin: oooh
Darryl: Me.
Phyllis: Yeah.
Dwight: Right here.
Nellie: Allow me to solve your problem, then.
Jim: Nellie
Nellie: Mmm. [bites sandwich] Oh, that is disgusting. Do you call that a King James breakfast pie?
Jim: What brings you to town?
Nellie: Certainly not the Harry Houdini Museum. What a nobody. Oh look, some Hungarian just found their way out of a sack. Let's build a shrine. No, I've come to work here.
Dwight: What?
Dwight: How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.
Toby: Robert did say you'd be joining us. Welcome. I'm Tony.
Nellie: Mm.
Pam: What?
Toby: I- I said I'm Tony. Okay I made a mistake. I thought it might go unnoticed. But uh, I'm Toby.
Pam: You messed up saying your name?
Toby: It happens, okay? Uh, so let's just find an empty desk for you, and uh, I'm sure Robert will be with you as soon as he gets in.
Nellie: That one looks empty.
Jim: No, that's Andy's office.
Nellie: Oh, is it?
Nellie: I have one simple philosophy in business: if the seat is open, the job is open. It's how I came to briefly race a formula one car. The three slowest laps ever recorded.
Erin: Another beautiful day in Tallahassee. Ooh. Good morning, Alonzo.
Alonzo: Good morning Erin. [driving by delivering newspapers]
Erin: How are you? How's your family doing?
Erin: Bye.
Erin: Look at this place! Five rooms, and I get to clean them all. That's right. I'm a maid for an old lady. Her grandson's staying with us too because he ran out of money. [chuckles] Listen to me, bragging away.
Robert: Nellie.
Nellie: Robert.
Robert: How are you adjusting to life in Scranton so far?
Nellie: So far, so good.
Robert: Good.
Nellie: Water pressure in the hotel is marvelous.
Robert: Ah, well, it is astounding what a difference that can make, isn't it?
Nellie: Mm-hm.
Robert: Now. Let's find you something fun to do here, shall we?
Nellie: Oh, I've already found it. I am manager, a natural next step. It fits like a glove.
Robert: We have a manager.
Nellie: Do you really? Because it is 10:00. I've been in this chair for an hour, and no other manager has come and sat in my lap.
Robert: Excuse me, has anyone seen Andy this morning?
Kevin: Huh. Yeah, that's weird. He's usually here by now. Right guys?
Andy: [on phone] Hello.
Robert: Andy, it's Robert. Why aren't you at work?
Andy: Hey, Robert. Ah, I really wish I could come in to work today, but I'm super sick.
Robert: I don't care, I don't care. Please come to work immediately.
Andy: Okay, I'll try to come in even though I'm really sick with the...
Andy: [standing in ocean] ...Florida Flu.
Robert: He just hung up on me mid-sentence.
Andy: I'm in Florida to get Erin. As soon as I heard she wasn't coming back to Scranton, I jumped straight in my car and drove straight down till I hit the ocean. My heart is my map. Turns out, Tallahassee is about 200 miles inland, so I overshot a good amount. But still, not bad for a heart map right? [picking up dead fish] Oh, no. Thanks a lot, BP.
Robert: Not much we can do about this until he gets here.
Jim: Can't you do something about this?
Robert: Sometimes the flowers arrange themselves, Jim.
Jim: -Right.
Jim: What is going on? And where's Andy? And what is going on?
Irene: Erin, you got a package.
Erin: I'm in the bathroom.
Glenn: Where's the postage? I mean, there's no shipping label.
Irene: Did you wash your hands?
Erin: Yes.
Erin and Irene: [screaming as Andy busts out of box]
Andy: [singing] Here I am; Signed, sealed, delivered; I'm yours!
Erin: Andy, what are you doing here? It's great to see you.
Andy: Uh, I am here to take you back to Scranton. Because I love you and I want to be with you.
Irene: Where's the ring?
Andy: Hm?
Irene: Where's the ring, Lancelot?
Erin: Uh, would you guys mind if we talked privately for a second? Sorry, Glenn.
Erin: Um, Andy... I am so happy to see you. But I'm not coming back with you.
Glenn: [whispering off screen] Why won't she go with him?
Irene: [whispering] I don't know. Maybe it's 'cause he's not that handsome.
Erin: Hey... don't listen.
Nellie: So what is going on? That does seem to be the question, doesn't it? [in American accent] Hey, this is messed up, bro. Who is this weird lady? [normal voice] I know. It's a lot. So, who knows what's going on? Anyone? You, yes. Wait, I am very good at intuiting names. Is it... chumbo?
Jim: I think it's a cross between Dumbo and Jumbo, with a hint of chubby. It's not a name.
Nellie: So no one can tell me what's going on. Well, let me illuminate things for you. We are getting to know each other. [in American accent] But why, m'lady? [in normal voice] Because I am your new manager.
Pam: Robert, is Nellie our new manager?
Robert: [laughs] This is an odd situation. But it's very interesting how it's playing out.
Robert: We live in this world of routines and rhythms. Kevin ate someone's lunch. Phyllis has a new necklace. Who is this woman?
Nellie: I came in here simply trying to get to know you, learn your names, maybe have someone teach me the company song. And what I got in return was nothing but disrespect. You leave me no choice but to get to know you in a more intimate way.
Kevin: Hot tub party?
Nellie: Performance reviews.
Pam: How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?
Nellie: On first impressions, so I recommend smiling. It goes a long way with me.
Glenn: Erin, you really nailed the hot dogs today.
Erin: Oh, thanks. I've been re-using the hot dog water so it gets more flavor. It's only going to keep getting better.
Irene: So, Andrew, how does your skinny brunette girlfriend Jessica feel about you visiting your ex-girlfriend?
Andy: Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.
Erin: So you came to get me, but you still have a girlfriend.
Irene: I think you should leave, young man.
Andy: All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.
Erin: You didn't even stop to pee? Gross.
Jim: Any luck?
Pam: No. He just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail.
Andy: [on phone message, singing] Please leave a message for Andy Bernard, include your na-
Erin: Oh, you're doing so good. Oh my God, you're superman over there. [Andy's phone vibrating]
Irene: You should take it. It's probably your girlfriend wondering where you are.
Andy: Nope. It's just work. Not important. You know, I can really feel this is my quads, I can tell I'm getting stronger.
Irene: You really wouldn't feel those kinds of results after one session.
Andy: I don't know. [phone vibrating] Just let it vibrate. It's fine.
Irene: You could put it on silent.
Andy: I don't think it does that.
Irene: Just go to preferences, then click '
Glenn: [answering Andy's phone] Proctology.
Jim: [on phone] Andy?
Andy: Jim?
Jim: Andy, where are you?
Andy: I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.
Irene: He's here in Tallahassee, trying to turn my life upside down.
Jim: What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Andy: What do you mean, take my job?
Jim: Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
Andy: Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.
Jim: Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.
Angela: Trust you? The way Pam trusted you to provide for her so she wouldn't have to work?
Pam: I like working here.
Jim: Dwight, should she be our manager?
Dwight: I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Dwight: Those who can't farm, farm celery.
Jim: And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat]
Nellie: All right. Let's get going. First up, it is the woman with the beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet, Phyllis.
Phyllis: Nellie, I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don't know.
Nellie: Oh. Oh, okay. I understand. Let me show you how these are gonna go. Dwight.
Dwight: I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Nellie: Dwight, I have completed your evaluation. You're getting a raise.
Dwight: What?
Nellie: Dwight, you carry this company on your massive shoulders. You are our Atlas, and for that do you not think you deserve a raise?
Dwight: There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
Nellie: Then you accept it?
Dwight: Five percent. No less.
Nellie: Absolutely not. Seven percent.
Dwight: Six percent, I know my worth.
Jim: The raise isn't real.
Dwight: Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Nellie: So Phyllis, now you know the rules of the game. Would you care to have a go? I'm fairly certain you're going to like it.
Pam: Phyllis.
Phyllis: Pam.
Nellie: So, Phyllis, I have been very impressed with you.
Phyllis: Really?
Nellie: Oh, yeah. The way you conquered your fear and came in here, and now the way you sit there... all very impressive.
Jim: Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?
Robert: I am not. Huh.
Jim: Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
Robert: Let me guess, you want one too? Take the family to Disneytown?
Jim: Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
Robert: Jim, I told Andy to come in, and yet he is still not in. By contrast, Nellie Bertram saw a vacuum and filled it. To make no mention of her business experience or her relationship with Jo Bennett, my boss.
Jim: Yes.
Robert: Jim, would you prefer a nature metaphor or a sexual metaphor?
Jim: Oh, god, nature, please.
Robert: When two animals are having sex, one of them...
Jim: [exhales sharply]
Robert: ' is communicating a message to the other. Nothing is mutua-- this isn't very helpful. You're gonna want to hear the sexual metaphor.
Jim: Was that not the--
Robert: All life is sex. And all sex is competition.
Jim: Mm-hm.
Robert: And there are no rules to that game. That wasn't so perverted, now was it?
Jim: Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
Robert: My point is, there is one person in charge of every office in America, and that person is Charles Darwin. In the end, doesn't he decide who the manager is?
Jim: No. I would've said no.
Nellie: Mm, let's see, review, review, review. Yes, good stuff. Here you go, have a raise.
Kelly: Oh, great.
Jim: I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.
Dwight: No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
Darryl: No.
Dwight: Yes.
Darryl: No.
Dwight: Yes.
Darryl: No.
Dwight: Yes.
Darryl: No.
Dwight: Yes.
Darryl: No.
Dwight: Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
Dwight: [Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Dwight: [panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.
Creed: Touch me and I'll sue.
Erin: I've heard that's amazing when it works.
Andy: Yeah, if I had my own--
Erin: Andy, I care about you and I think--
Andy: --sorry, you go.
Erin: No, go ahead.
Andy: Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?
Erin: Andy, you broke my heart. Do you know what it feels like to be constantly rejected by you and to have to watch you date someone else?
Andy: You broke my heart too.
Erin: You broke my heart more recently and more often. And I think at some point, in my head, it just sort of clicked that we're not meant to be.
Andy: I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.
Erin: I know.
Andy: [sighs]
Nellie: So, Pamela, I'm going to start this review, not by telling you what you lack, but rather, asking you what it is you want.
Pam: Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.
Nellie: That's not really what you want. What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.
Pam: Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?
Nellie: Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?
Pam: Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.
Nellie: You must be exhausted. Fancy a nap?
Pam: No.
Nellie: Go on. Have a nap. Lie down right here. There's a blanket in here. I used it earlier myself. Dreamt I could breathe underwater like Jacques Cousteau. No one will know. I'll wake you up. And when you wake up, you will earn more money.
Pam: I think... you're a witch.
Nellie: I think you're amazing. You know that, right? Go on, say it: 'I'm amazing.'
Pam: [drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs]
Irene: Erin, I think you're making a big mistake right now. Andy is a nice boy.
Erin: Really? 'cause you've been kind of a B to him all afternoon.
Irene: I was protecting you because I thought he was no good. But I can tell you really like him. And he's willing to lose his job for you, in this economy with Europe on the brink--
Erin: Irene, what would you do without me?
Irene: We're not your concern, sweetheart. Besides, Glenn's going to sue Home Depot.
Erin: Why?
Irene: He got his foreskin caught in some lawn furniture.
Nellie: Jim, time for your review.
Jim: No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Nellie: Why are you so staunchly defending your friend, who has abandoned you? Wouldn't you rather come talk with me? Maybe definitely get a raise?
Jim: Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
Nellie: Jim, have you ever heard of a character named Tinkerbell?
Jim: Yes.
Nellie: I'm Tinkerbell.
Jim: No.
Nellie: Mm-hm. I'm a magical fairy who floated into your office to bring a little bit of magic into your lives, to give you all raises.
Stanley: And we are grateful.
Nellie: But here's the thing about Tinkerbell, Jim. Everyone has to believe in her or she doesn't exist.
Jim: She dies.
Nellie: She dies! Now who here believes in Tinkerbell?
Jim: Let's see it. Show of hands.
Kevin: I do. [applause] Come on everyone...
Jim: All right, guys, stop.
Meredith: I already spent the money.
Jim: How?
Kevin: Come on Jim, you're killing her!
All: We believe! We believe!
Robert: Look at this wonderful recognition of Nellie's leadership. I believe. [applause continues]
Andy: That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.
Erin: Andy wait! [running down street] Andy! Andy wait! Don't go! Andy I love you! Stop! Oh, this is the wrong Prius. I don't love you. I'm sorry.
Andy: Erin!
Erin: Andy. [horns honking as they kiss in the street]
Erin: Let's get out of here.
Andy: Okay.
Erin: Let's go.
Andy: Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.
Erin: No, I don't have any stuff.
Andy: Like your toothbrush and stuff.
Erin: I don't have one.
Andy: You don't have a toothbrush?
Erin: No.
Andy: How do you not have a toothbrush?
Erin: I just... there's always one around.
Andy: You just use whichever one is sitting there?
Erin: I always find one. Have you ever heard of buying a toothbrush?
Andy: Of course. I own my toothbrush.
Nellie: I grew up poor. I had little formal education. No real skills. I don't work especially hard, and most of my ideas are either unoriginal or total crap. And yet, I walked right into a job for which I was ill-prepared, ill-suited, and somebody else already had, and I got it. If you ask me, that's the American dream right there. Anything can happen to anyone. It's just random.
David Wallace: ...No, you lied to me Andy. You pretended to be in this office for three months and you were sailing on your boat!
Andy: I resent that. I, I never lied to you.
David: Really? [reading from phone] 'Hey David, all is good in Scranton PA.'
Andy: And all was good in Scranton PA that day.
David: 'By the way, Oscar says 'hi''
Andy: Oscar says 'hi' all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hola' You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say 'hi'?
David: Andy.
Andy: But you're calling me a liar.
David: Andy!
Andy: By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.
David: Watch it Andy!
Andy: Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] 'Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.' Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!
David: My wife?
Andy: This has been a really tough time.
David: Yeah?
Andy: Yeah.
David: Has it?
Andy: Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.
David: Shh.
Andy: It was like a security blan-
David: Andy.
Andy: -ket
David: Shh. I'm not gonna fire you.
Andy: You're not?
David: No.
Andy: That's awesome.
David: I wouldn't own the company if it wasn't for you. So...I owe you that.
Andy: David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.
David: We are even...now. Understand? Got it?
Andy: Crystal.
David: You are on very- Hey, very thin ice.
Andy: Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.
Andy: Good morning.
Erin: Good morning.
Andy: And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]
Andy: [Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.
Andy: [Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh
Pam: He sounds like a wounded animal.
Stanley: Should've put him out of his misery and just fired her.
Phyllis: I can't be around sad people, it makes me sad.
Stanley: I'm the same way with horny people.
Pam: Ok. [Andy continues moaning]
Erin: Yes. Pete and I have started seeing each other and Andy still doesn't know. We thought that keeping it secret was more considerate to him. And hot for us. I mean I saw Pete's butt. It's sick.
Pam: [taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.
Pam: Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.
Dwight: [on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.
Dwight: [Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.
Angela: Ahh! Dwight!
Dwight: And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
Angela: What? What is it?
Dwight: It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
Angela: Dwight, that's awful.
Dwight: You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was 'poisoned' by Aunt Shirley.
Angela: What do you mean by 'poisoned'?
Dwight: Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
Angela: Ok, well I'm very sorry about your aunt.
Dwight: Thank you.
Angela: But I don't see how this is my problem.
Dwight: Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
Angela: Ugh.
Dwight: And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
Angela: Gah.
Dwight: There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
Angela: It's fine.
Dwight: It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
Angela: Ugh! God, I can't. OK, I'll-
Dwight: It's a divet...
Angela: I'll help you!
Dwight: ..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
Angela: Ugh.
Andy: Where are you going?
Pam: Uh, not on a three month boat trip.
Andy: Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?
Dwight: How dare you?
Andy: I'm still the boss!
Erin: I...
Andy: The answer is yes.
Erin: ..just have some messages for you.
Andy: Are they from you?
Erin: Well no, they're from clients.
Andy: Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.
Erin: I can't. I-
Andy: Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.
Erin: These are messages from clients who want to buy paper.
Andy: I don't want to talk about work right now.
Erin: Well I only want to talk about work right now.
Andy: Then I want my big blue sweater back.
Erin: Well, I gave it to the Salvation Army.
Pete: I've got the seat adjusted right.
Clark: Perfect height, yeah.
Andy: She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?
Pete: I was just leaving.
Andy: Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.
Pete: I don't know. Women do tend to move on quicker than men.
Andy: Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?
Clark: Look at it this way, being a bachelor is not all bad. I mean, you've got your freedom now.
Andy: Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.
Clark: There you go, good for you.
Andy: No.
Clark: You just let it all hang out, that's what...
Andy: May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]
Clark: I'll give you a hundred dollars to wear that sweater to work tomorrow.
Dwight: Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.
Shirley: Oh, lookie here. It's big city Dwight. Careful you don't get mud on those fancy town shoes, big city Dwight.
Angela: Hello Aunt Shirley.
Shirley: Who's this little kitchen witch? She's so tiny like a little kitchen witch.
Dwight: This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
Shirley: New clothes? What for? [Aunt Shirley's boob shows]
Dwight: OK
Angela: Oh, God.
Dwight: You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
Angela: Yes. How would you like a nice warm bath?
Shirley: How would you like a mean cold slap? [slaps Angela]
Angela: Ow!
Dwight: Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
Shirley: I could do that.
Dwight: Ok.
Angela: No. No.
Dwight: Yeah, trust me.
Angela: No.
Dwight: It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Shirley: Step on it!
Andy: Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.
Phyllis: Andy, don't. No good can come from snooping.
Andy: I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.
Oscar: You're clearly snooping.
Creed: That's kinda uncool, man.
Meredith: Ah, come on.
Phyllis: Andy!
Oscar: That's her private property.
Meredith: Tell us!
Andy: Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?
Phyllis: What does that even mean?
Meredith: What's it say?
Phyllis: Put it down.
Andy: Everyone please, just-
Creed: It's not cool.
Phyllis: Put it down
Oscar: Andy. That is her private property.
Meredith: Boo.
Andy: Oh my god.
Stanley: Uh huh.
Phyllis: See?
Stanley: That's where nosey'll get you.
Phyllis: Told you so.
Andy: Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.
Darryl: Man, you can't do that stuff. You'll only find pain. When my ex-wife got into my e-mail account, she was devastated.
Andy: Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?
Kevin: Pete...
Clark: Hmm.
Kevin: Pete what?
Pete: It just occurred to me that Andy has been calling me Plop for so long, he forgot my real name. Which is Pete.
Pam: [whispers] hello!
Jim: Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?
Pam: Hi! Hey, do I look ok?
Jim: You look great.
Pam: Ok
Jim: Yeah.
Pam: [pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-
Jim: Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]
Isaac: Gotta go, VIP just walked through the door.
Pam: How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.
Isaac: It's a phone?
Pam: Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.
Isaac: Of course, anything for Team Halpert. You're gonna crush it, Pam.
Pam: Thanks.
Jim: You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Pam: Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.
Jim: [touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?
Pam: Ha ha.
Athlead Coworker: Hey, Jim! We've got Trent Edwards on the line.
Jim: I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!
Pam: Bye.
Angela: Gosh, she drank so much. And so quickly.
Dwight: In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
Shirley: [coughs and laughs in her sleep]
Dwight: Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
Angela: Spray her down?
Dwight: No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
Pete: Hey.
Andy: Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?
Pete: Yeah. [long pause] You were gone.
Andy: I knew it!
Pete: For a long time, Andy.
Andy: You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!
Pete: Andy, just so you know, there was no overlap.
Andy: No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!
Pete: What?
Andy: Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-
Pete: Andy?
Andy: ..The camera don't lie!
Pete: Andy.
Andy: You're being an idiot get..
Pete: I'm trying..
Andy: Out of my office, turns out you're fired...
Pete: Andy.
Andy: Because you suck.
Pete: You can't fire-
Andy: And you're fired...
Pete: If you want to talk to me
Andy: So you had a bad day...
Pete: I'll be in the annex.
Andy: Rut ti doh doh...
Pete: Alright? I'll be in the annex.
Andy: Rut tit doh doh...
Pete: Toby!
Andy: Rut ti doh doo doh
Pete: Toby?
Toby: You can't fire Pete. You understand why, right?
Andy: No.
Toby: Oh, Andy, we had this exact same conversation when you wanted to get rid of Nellie. You can't just get rid of people over grudges.
Andy: Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.
Toby: Alright, well look. While I have you here, this is a relationship disclosure form for Pete & Erin.
Andy: They already have a contract? [Reading] 'Mutually agree to-' Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.
Toby: It's just boiler plating, you don't have to read it.
Andy: Well, I'm not signing away my rights.
Toby: I already signed it. I was just showing you.
Andy: Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]
Toby: Andy, it's not the original. And destroying it will not stop them from dating. Andy. [Andy throws paper at him and leaves, Toby straightens paper out] It's the original.
Mark: ...[singing] talking Chester avenue, talking triplex, talking converting...Is that her? Hey guys! Say something.
Pam: Hello.
Mark: Hi, I'm Mark.
Pam: Hi, Pam, hello.
Mark: I'm the horrible boss around here, but please don't hire Jamie Foxx to kill me. D'Jango! I don't agree with the use of the 'N' word in that movie. It's, it's too soon.
Pam: I'm Pam Halpert.
Mark: Oh, hi. They call me Marky Mark around here, because here at Simon Realty, we are one funky bunch! Come on you guys, raise the roof when I say that! I- what are you all temps again today? Let's go, Gangnam style. [laughs] He's heard Gangnam style, he knows it. Right? That's cause he's American. This is Carl. Uh, he's from here. Our neck of the woods. But Gangnam style is great, isn't it?
Pam: Oh my god. He's Michael Scott.
Shirley: Time to get clean!
Dwight: It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
Angela: You have to use chains?
Dwight: You'll see. Here we go.
Shirley: Let's get this show on the road.
Dwight: Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
Angela: Dwight!
Dwight: Let's get to it.
Angela: No! No!
Dwight: Give it a whirl.
Angela: Dwight, I am not gonna hose your aunt down like some animal.
Shirley: Stop your belly-aching and hose me.
Dwight: I need you to hose my aunt.
Angela: No Dwight!
Dwight: OK you are useless.
Angela: No, Dwight!
Dwight: Give me the hose!
Angela: No Dwight, I won't- [hoses Dwight]
Dwight: Ahh! OK!
Angela: [grunting] I'm gonna give your aunt a proper bath and a haircut like a lady! And you two are gonna shut up about it! Do you have a bathtub?
Dwight: Yes ma'am.
Angela: Good.
Mark: This is not an office so much as it is a uh, rec room with a bunch of computers in it. Frankly, if I had my way, I'd toss the computers in the gar-bage. But unfortunately we use them for practically everything we do. So. That ain't gonna happen. He's a temp, don't worry about him. Alice! Alright, stay awake ok?
Toby: Hey Nellie. Mmm. I am so sick of February. It's the shortest month but it sure doesn't feel that way. We should catch up.
Nellie: Um.
Toby: Y'know I've been going over my notes from the trial...
Nellie: Oh no.
Toby: ...feel like I may have glossed over a few...
Nellie: No no no no.
Toby: ...minor points.
Nellie: No. Toby, you cannot keep blathering on about this Scranton Strangler. Do something about it. Get it out of your system, whatever it takes.
Toby: I've been drafting a letter.
Nellie: For two years! Then what? Another year picking out a stamp? Another six months before you decide to lick it? Just- I don't want to hear it!
Mark: My aunt Joan. Oh, uh well, she uh, she worked here before I did, so there's no nepotism involved. In fact, to be honest with you I'm probably a little harder on her than I am on the rest of these people. Ah, cute. Not work on this...work on this months. Ok Nana? Uh, when I say 'Chillax' people chillax. Watch this. Hey Roger, chillax! Must not have heard me.
Roger: No. I heard you.
Mark: Step this way for The Spanish Inquisition! [laughs] Kids in the Hall. Just, it's not high pressure. Just a little Coffee Talk. Ok? Like butta. Come on in here. Mike Myers.
Pam: [Mouths] Oh my god.
Andy: Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.
Meredith: Hey boss, I did everything I could. I invited Pete out for drinks, I emailed him shots of my junk....
Andy: Ugh.
Meredith: Kid doesn't have a romantic bone in his body.
Phyllis: Come on Andy, they're a good match.
Andy: That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.
Darryl: Hey, Andy.
Andy: What?!
Darryl: You've got a booger bubble going on there.
Andy: [wipes nose] Sorry.
Darryl: It's ok.
Andy: My whole life is a booger bubble!
Mark: This is a tiny resume. Papa Smurf! Come back to the mushroom. [Pam laughs] From The Smurfs movie.
Pam: Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-
Mark: What does this say here? To ti te per tat... what language is this? Swahili? Oh wait a second, now I can read it.
Pam: Oh, cause it was upside down. [both laugh]
Mark: You're a good audience. [Pam laughs]
Pam: So um-
Mark: Unlike some of these people around here.
Pam: Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-
Mark: Yeah, we don't have a lot of call for doodling around here. But I like this resume and here's why. It shows that you stick around. Yeah. You don't jump ship easily. Like a lot of these people. I mean they worship me you know? But do they like me? I mean...you think they like me, Pam?
Pam: Yes.
Mark: [gets guitar] What if Bob Dylan was your boss? I'm gonna do Dylan! [playing guitar and imitating Bob Dylan] Pam Halpert is my name, and I've been at Dunder Mifflin for seven years? Eight years? Eight years, man. Got the Dunder Mifflin blues. Got the Pam Halpert blues. Got the pra- went to the Pratt Institute...You have children?
Pam: Two children, yes.
Mark: You wrote Art and Painting, kinda the same thing. Kinda the same thing. Sometimes I repeat myself, but that's just being Pam. Well I'm kinda cute and I'm- but I'm married so...leave that be.
Pete: Hey. You got a sec to talk?
Andy: Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.
Pete: Yeah. Look, uh I understand breakups are tough. You know, it happens to all of us at some point in life. But you've gotta move on.
Andy: Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.
Erin: Listen to him, Andy. He's trying to tell you something that you really need to hear.
Andy: Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.
Pete: Well, I've been where you are now. I dated this girl Alice and it was an ugly breakup. She worked at a marketing agency right next to my house. I'd run into her every day but I had to grow up and deal with it, and I did. We're even Facebook friends now.
Erin: See? We can all be friends!
Pete: Yeah.
Erin: Just, get over it. It doesn't have to be awkward.
Pete: I do think we can have a fair....
Andy: Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.
Mark: Nothing to see here! Boss at work. This will be your desk. Right up front. Best seat on the roller coaster, you must be this tall to ride this ride. No pregnant women allowed. Are you? Uh, yeah I don't- not allowed to ask. So...
Pam: I am not pr-
Mark: You're not.
Pam: Pregnant, no.
Mark: I didn't ask her if she was pregnant. She just offered it. The last three girls here all got pregnant.
Pam: Wow.
Mark: Don't be afraid, it's a different chair. I don't want a guy up here. I want to you know, see a woman come in and do a great job. Something that, I have to look out this window, I want someone-
Pam: I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.
Mark: It is. Yeah, you would uh manage this office. Answer the phones and forward the calls and uh you know, go for a coffee run now and again.
Pam: So, kinda like a receptionist.
Mark: Yeah, like a receptionist, but we call you the office manager because uh, it's less demeaning. By the way, how long are these uh, cameras gonna be following you around? Because I think this is pretty cool. Pretty pretty cool. Larry David, Curb Your Enthusiasm. Do you like that show?
Pam: Yes.
Mark: Well, I think they indulge themselves a little too much. I like scripted.
Pam: I spent 10 years as a receptionist, to Michael Scott. And I have kids now. And I just, I can't.
Shirley: Ow! The braid is too tight.
Angela: Oh hush. Loose braids reflect a loose character. Now stay still.
Shirley: Yes ma'am.
Angela: I think your hair is much too long for your age, by the way.
Shirley: Ok.
Angela: There.
Shirley: Thank you Angela.
Toby: I'm going to the prison. This afternoon. I'm gonna talk to the strangler.
Nellie: Probably best to use his real name rather than strangler.
Darryl: Don't use his real name. George Howard Scubb. It's a devil name.
Toby: Well I just wanted to say I'm doing it. [Toby leaves]
Nellie: He's doing it.
Pam: [on phone] hey!
Jim: Hey, how'd the interview go?
Pam: Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-
Jim: I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
Pam: Eight? Really?
Jim: I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
Pam: Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.
Jim: Alright, love you.
Pam: Love you.
Alice: Hi.
Erin: Hi.
Alice: I'm here from BCI Marketing Consultants to meet with Andrew Bernard.
Erin: Yes. The consultant. Andy said you can start right away so I will take you to your desk.
Alice: Ok, great. Thanks.
Meredith: Fresh meat! Fresh meat! [Making kissing noises]
Erin: Just keep walking, don't give her anything. She'll take it and run. I'm Erin by the way.
Alice: Nice to meet you. Cute sweater.
Erin: Oh, thanks. Your shoes match. I'm bad at small talk.
Kevin: I'm Kevin.
Alice: Pete?
Pete: Alice. Oh man.
Alice: It's uh, been a while, huh?
Erin: What, do you two know each other?
Pete: Yeah. We uh, have a history.
Erin: Oh.
Alice: History. Wow, ok. We dated for two years.
Erin: That's so random.
Pete: Well. Is it?
Erin: Andy also hired a management consultant today. Oh no. [runs to front office]
Creed: Hey Erin, look who's back. The bird man.
Gabe: Hello beautiful.
Kevin: Didn't you two used to do it?
Gabe: We absolutely did. Thank you for remembering that.
Creed: She's looking good.
Toby: Hi, I'm uh, Toby Flenderson. I'm here to see George Howard Scubb.
Toby: This is the prison. Uh, I am not going in there with expectations, per say. Uh, I will meet George Howard Scubb. I will tell him that I believe he is innocent. I would understand if he felt motivated to hug me. I would understand if a friendship began. How did, how did Bogart put it? [imitating Humphrey Bogart] I think this is a start of my first friendship.
Clark: So Pete was a librarian?
Alice: He worked as a librarian freshman year.
Clark: Was he like the sexy librarian?
Pete: Ok.
Alice: Is there like somebody who's in charge of marketing? Maybe I should sit near him or her.
Andy: Hi.
Alice: Hi.
Andy: Hi, how's it going?
Alice: Hi. [laughs] Good. I'd love to discuss strategy with you if you have a marketing p-
Andy: Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?
Pete: Andy, that is really inappropriate.
Andy: Awkward.
Pete: It is awkward. This is a really uncomfortable situation that you've contrived.
Andy: [high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.
Pete: Yeah.
Andy: It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta 'move on'. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]
Alice: So there's no marketing department.
Clark: No.
Pete: No.
Gabe: You know, times were tough. I was unemployed, I was still heart-broken over you, I've lost a good fifty pounds. But as you can see I put all that weight right back on. Feel how fat my buttocks are. Yeah, it's crazy. Touch it. It's like a warm pumpkin.
Erin: So Andy just called you up out of the blue?
Gabe: Yeah. He told me you two broke up.
Erin: Yeah.
Gabe: You must be pretty horny. [Erin shakes head no]
Nellie: well, the good news is no more guilty conscience. At least you know he is the strangler. The proof is in the grip. Did they say when the vocal cords would heal? [Toby nods] One week? [Toby shakes head] Ok, two weeks? [Toby nods] Ok. You offered your neck in search of the truth. The proud neck of justice. Isn't that the expression? No. Well, anyway, it was, it was very brave. It really was quite brave.
Shirley: I feel like a show pony.
Dwight: And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Angela: You're welcome. Would you like some stew?
Dwight: By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
Angela: Mmhm.
Dwight: Would you like the stink sack?
Angela: Is it any good?
Dwight: No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Angela: Thank you. [both laugh]
Shirley: So, when's the wedding?
Angela: Oh, um actually uh, we are just friends.
Shirley: That's what Mose said about his lady scarecrow and look what he did to that poor thing.
Pam: Hello?
Jim: Hey! Back here.
Pam: Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?
Jim: Si, senor.
Pam: Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.
Jim: Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Pam: Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.
Jim: Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Pam: [laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.
Jim: Alright. So, tell me all about it.
Dwight: Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.
Angela: It was not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon. [They shake hands. Then kiss] Dwight, Dwight.
Dwight: Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
Angela: No, Dwight. The Senator.
Dwight: Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
Angela: I can't be your monkey, Dwight.
Dwight: I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Angela: I made a vow. I gave my word.
Dwight: Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
Angela: Good night, D.
Erin: How are you doing? Is it really rough?
Pete: It is so unpleasant. You?
Andy: Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.
Andy: Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?
Gabe: Honestly, it was a little weird.
Andy: Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?
Gabe: I still wear Erin's button-downs around the condo sometimes. So it feels to me like we're still in a relationship-
Erin: Gabe!
Gabe: ...a lot of the time.
Andy: And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.
Pete: Dude, it was an amicable break up Andy.
Alice: Ok, while we're rewriting history, you never had a drinking problem.
Pete: It was college. That is what you do.
Alice: Yeah you're also supposed to go to classes, so there's that.
Erin: Hey, Andy, is this at all work related?
Andy: We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?
Gabe: [laughs] Oh no no no no no no. She wouldn't even let me say it. It was adorable. She would plug her ears and scream her heat out.
Erin: Gabe, can you stop talking? Cause every word out of your mouth is like the squawk of an ugly pelican.
Gabe: I got a tattoo for you.
Erin: I didn't ask you to get that Nike Swoosh. Nobody did! You did that for you!
Gabe: Just do it. You were the it that I was just doing.
Alice: So you're dating a secretary now? Moving up in the world, Pete.
Pete: She's nice to me.
Alice: How's that P.E. degree coming? That's what he wanted to be. His dream in college was to be a gym teacher.
Erin: Well, guess what? He could still be a gym teacher. In fact, we could all still be gym teachers, so, let's-
Gabe: I technically cannot. I don't have the lung capacity to blow a whistle.
Pete: Oh my god.
Gabe: What kind of music are you into, Peter?
Pete: Uh, I like all kinds of music, Gabe.
Gabe: Really? All kinds? So you like songs of hate written by the white knights of the Ku Klux Klan?
Pete: No!
Gabe: Erin, are you even hearing this?
Erin: He didn't even say that.
Alice: He is not a very sophisticated man, I mean he can't even use chopsticks, so. Do I need to say anything else?
Gabe: Erin, I've been to Japan. I know how to use chopsticks so well. Come back. One night.
Erin: Gabe, I don't-
Gabe: Give me one night with you...
Erin: What is that supposed to mean?
Gabe: I have shaved everything...
Erin: I don't want you to shave everything.
Alice: I wasted two years of my life on you, you realize that right?!
Pete: I just want to be real clear that chopsticks is not the measure of a man. [Erin and Gabe argue in background]
Gabe: I am as smooth as a porpoise. {Erin argues]
Pete: Why don't you say in the beginning: 'This isn't really going that well'
Gabe: Shove his sashimi!
Erin: What do you-!
Alice: Because I had to wait- [all argue]
Andy: Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Pam: So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.
Jim: Tell me about the cologne. How much?
Pam: Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.
Jim: You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
Pam: Guess what poster he had on his wall?
Jim: Austin Powers.
Pam: MmMm.
Jim: Ferris Bueller.
Pam: MmMm. You're getting colder.
Jim: Not Night at the Roxbury.
Pam: [laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.
Jim: I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Pam: I don't know, but it's interesting right?
Jim: It's fascinating.
Pam: He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.
Jim: That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
Pam: Mmhm.
Jim: So, next interview has to be better.
Pam: I don't know.
Jim: What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
Pam: I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.
Jim: [long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.
Pam: Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.
Jim: And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs]
Oscar's Computer: My grandfather know. Mah Jong will be here to stay. Hobbies of the East continues in a moment.
Oscar: You could all be doing this, just saying.
Oscar: I watch way too many ads online and I don't do enough situps. So I bought these. Now, every time an ad pops up online, I get 30 seconds of ab blasting. I call it Ads for Abs. Ironically, I learned about the boots from an ad online.
Stanley: Why can't you just do regular sit-ups?
Oscar: I'll tell you why. Because...the floor...is...disgusting. Yeah, my trainer said everybody fails working out, that's how you win. Alright [tries to pull himself up] Ok. Kevin? A little help buddy?
Kevin: Oh, why don't your famous stomachs help you now?
Oscar: Can someone please help me?
Phyllis: Ow, these teas are hot, can someone help me please? [Erin moves Oscar out of the way for Phyllis]
Oscar: Just- People! I'm not going anywhere. Soon, my core will get strong again and when that happens I'll be able to- Head rush! Ah! Can someone please help me? [Kevin shuts door] I- Hey! I'm not going anywhere! I'll be right here! Oh that's not good. [Oscars computer reads: Coming this May: The Office: An American Workplace. Ten years in the making, a look at the lives and loves of an average American small business office.] Hey guys! I've got twenty bucks for anyone who will help me. Kevin, would you like a pizza?
Dwight: [as elevator door closes] Hold it!
Creed: [notices something new about Dwight] New glasses.
Erin: Dwight. What a ridiculous, fancy clown you are.
Dwight: I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
Pam: Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?
Dwight: I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
Dwight: My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.
Jim: My condolences.
Dwight: Keep them.
Jim: OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
Dwight: In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.
Erin: [after Dwight tosses dirt on her face] What color is it?
Phyllis: It looks pretty black.
Kevin: [after Dwight tosses dirt in his face] Yep. Acidic, all right.
Oscar: [while Dwight prepares to toss dirt] Oh, thank god.
Dwight: Excuse me?
Oscar: I'm so sorry, Dwight. And if you want me to be there, of course I will go. I just... have a personal training session...
Dwight: OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face]
Oscar: I get red dirt. Nobody is getting red dirt. I should've kept my mouth shut. We're not even that close. I've only known Dwight... 12 years. 12 years. Time is a son of a bitch.
Jim: [as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.
Dwight: I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face]
Jim: OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Dwight: I miss her so much.
Jim: OK.
Dwight: You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim]
Mose: [playing guitar and singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning'] Zeke's here.
Dwight: Zeke.
Zeke: Hey, Dwight. Mose, Mom says 'hi'.
Mose: Hi' to Mom.
Dwight: Are you going?
Mose: Will there be ghosts there?
Dwight: [simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Zeke: You get in the sidecar.
Dwight: Get...
Dwight: [at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?
Oscar: You invited me. You threw the red dirt in my face.
Dwight: [smirking] Oh, yeah.
Oscar: [as a car approaches the grave site] Who is that?
Dwight: Jeb, my brother.
Oscar: You have a brother?
Dwight: Uh-huh.
Jeb: I didn't really see a better parking spot. [drives into the dug grave] Whoa! Look what I did. It's a rental. [Dwight approaches and hugs him] You wanna go in? [both attempt to put the other in the dug grave]
Erin: [upon seeing Todd Packer enter the office] Oh, gosh.
Todd Packer: Hey, Moonface. Nice to see those shiny, little Chinese eyes of yours.
Clark: [to Pam] Who's this guy?
Pam: ' bad.
Todd Packer: Hi, all.
Phyllis: Why are you here, Todd?
Todd Packer: OK. Let's get right to it. I guess. My name is Todd Packer and I am in recovery. I'm working the steps. I'm on step eight of Alcoholics Anonymous and step nine of Narcotics Anonymous. I'm here to make amends. I've been hard to deal with over the past years. Kind of a jerk. I know it. I don't need you to accept my apology, but I'd love it if you did.
Kevin: Packer, we accept. [others disagree]
Todd Packer: Actually, they have a specific way I need to do this. And, I have to go through examples of stuff.  OK. Uh, where to begin. [to Pam] Hey. Pam-pam and her pam-pams. Wow. I have said some crude things about those. But, they are beautiful. And, I guess that's why I acted out. Pam, I'm sorry I objectified you. And, personified your breasts. Sorry, guys. [to Phyllis] Oh boy. I have not been nice to you. Philly, I'm sorry for the things I said about your size. To your face, behind your back, and in the form of drawings. Actually, that goes to all you double XLs. Stanley, Kevin, [points to Clark] this kid in a few years.
Pam: Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.
Todd Packer: Why can't I just be nice? Truth is, I really like you guys. I really do. OK. The apology's just half of it. The big thing is making amends. And, that's why I brought these. I went out to the Steamtown Mall and I got you all cupcakes. From that place 'Nipples'.
Pam: I think it's called 'Nibbles'.
Todd Packer: Huh. The mind sees what it wants to, huh? [hands cupcake to Erin] There you go.
Pam: Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.
German Minister: We are here today to join this woman and the ground. Man is born of woman and his life is full of turmoil.
Jeb: [gathers and tastes soil] Huh. It's crap soil. Nothing's going to grow here.
Dwight: Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
Jeb: Yeah, well, I'm just saying it's garbage soil, that's all.
Dwight: Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
Jeb: It's fine 'cause they're not going to grow.
Dwight: Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Jeb: Good. I agree. Don't worry about it. You won't get any.
German Minister: Would the family care to say something?
Dwight: You had black hair and then gray hair.
Zeke: You were the aunt to my cousins. Most of your life you were 5'4', at the end you were 5'1'.
Oscar: They're a descriptive people.
Fannie: [approaches and hugs Dwight] I see you started without me.
Dwight: You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
Fannie: Well, I told you...
Jeb: Hi, Fannie.
Fannie: Hey.
Oscar: Who is that?
Zeke: Dwight's sister.
Oscar: Dwight has a sister?
Zeke: Yeah.
Oscar: She's beautiful.
Zeke: Blugh.
Dwight: [to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.
Henry: Dwight.
Dwight: I see Esther's back in town.
Esther: Hi Dwight.
Dwight: Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
Esther: This was on the way. We're going into town after. I need yarn.
Dwight: Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
Fannie: We're at a funeral. There's a funeral going on here.
Dwight: OK.
Henry: Anyone mention her height?
Zeke: Yep.
Henry: Land size? [all shake heads] [removes hat] Shirley, at 1600 acres, you have the largest farm in the area. Sharing borders with six other farms. Including my own farm. And your nephew Dwight's. [replaces hat] OK. [drives away]
Dwight: So, let's get it going.
German Minister: [approaches Fannie, offering a shotgun] Would you want to do the honors?
Fannie: Oh, right. Uh, you know, I don't think we have to do this.
Dwight: We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.
Oscar: [after Dwight opens coffin and begins firing into it] That's it for me. [exits]
Pam: I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.
Phyllis: I agree. Even though that place has a way of making those cupcakes so they're dense. But, they're also really fluffy.
Pam: We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?
Creed: $3.75 a cupcake, actually. $3.67 if you buy a dozen.
Creed: I never forget a number. Names? In one ear and out the other. Places? Nope. Faces? That's rich. But, numbers? I have a gift. I guess that's why I'm an accountant.
Clark: Hey, man. I don't think we've met. I'm Clark.
Todd Packer: Oh. I'm Todd. Oh, sorry for calling you a fat, little runt earlier.
Clark: You didn't actually say that.
Todd Packer: No? Wow. I'm in this mode now where I'm apologizing for thoughts that are in my head. [Clark fake laughs] Hey. I have a crazy feeling [hands Clark a cupcake] that you are really gonna like this.
Stanley: Maybe we should eat the cupcakes. Haven't we done enough to Packer? I mean, we sent him down to Florida on a prank. [to Nellie] And you did fire him.
Nellie: I did. I did, yes. And it was purely political. He did nothing wrong.
Pam: Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?
Angela: Do they even have a bakery anymore?
Kevin: They do. It's awful. And, it's getting worse every day.
Pam: So, it really is just about the cupcakes.
Andy: Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.
Phyllis: So, we're all agreed? No one touches those cupcakes?
Meredith: [as all agree] OK.
Phyllis: OK. Packer can go to hell.
Aunt Shirley: [on a recorded video] Thank you for coming to my funeral. As I gaze at life's big sunset, I can't help but wonder where it all went wrong. You've all disappointed me greatly. Fannie. A single mamma in the city.
Dwight: [agreeing with Shirley] Thank you.
Aunt Shirley: Jeb. A street pusher.
Jeb: After I left the army, I bought a 9-acre worm farm from a Californian. Turns out 'worm' means something else out there. And, I am now in the business of... pain management. Or, the smoking of pain management.
Dwight: I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.
Aunt Shirley: We can't just sit by and watch our family farm disappear. So, here are my terms. Dwight, Fannie, Jeb. If you come back home, I will leave you my farm. So, there, you have it.
Fannie: Is she crazy? [as Dwight considers] Dwight?
Jeb: Buddy? Buddy?
Fannie: No, no, no.
Jeb: Snap out of it. Dwight?
Dwight: Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.
Fannie: No, no, no. I'm not moving back here. Are you crazy?
Dwight: Of course you are.
Fannie: Look. I, I don't want to be mean or like insulting. I know that you like it here. But, Dwight, it's just that farm life lacks a certain... sort of sophistication.
Dwight: Oh my god.
Fannie: That Cammy and I are drawn to. And, I don't know. The men are just... it's almost like there's a... a willing ignorance.
Fannie: Yes. I, thank you for asking me. I actually have written a little bit of poetry. That's crazy. And, I was recently published. Which is just... [reaches in to bag, removes folded paper] maybe I have. Yep. I do. Here it is from the um, Hartford Women's Lit Quarterly.com. A Willing Ignorance by Fannie Schrute.
Jeb: Totally. Yep. The people here are like [makes farting sound, laughs] Like a fart. You know what I'm saying? Like a fart?
Dwight: You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
Jeb: Couple of nights couldn't hurt.
Fannie: Uh, somehow how I think a couple of nights could hurt.
Dwight: You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.
Zeke: [as Dwight says 'yes'] Absolutely.
Zeke: Growing up with Dwight and Mose was not easy. Uh, Dwight was obviously the cool one. And, Mose was the visionary. Which left me to be the comedian.
Fannie: That doesn't work on me.
Dwight: OK.
Fannie: By the way, that's not...
Dwight: [counts down in French]
Fannie: Very funny. OK. Oui, oui, oui.
Dwight: Oui.
Fannie: Oh my goodness.
Dwight: [while everyone is gathered playing and singing 'Sons & Daughters'] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.
Fannie: [after seeing Dwight lay something down in front of Esther] So, I forgot about this old custom. If a man is interested in courting a woman, he may throw the beaks of a crow at her. And then, if she's interested in accepting the courtship, she has to destroy the beaks. [Esther crushes the beaks leaving Dwight satisfied]
Todd Packer: Hey, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for screwing you.
Meredith: I'm not sorry about it.
Todd Packer: I am. It was my rock bottom.
Angela: [while Kevin stares at his cupcake] Kevin, you can do this.
Kevin: You don't know that.
Pam: Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?
Angela: Uh-huh.
Kevin: James Bond was a spy.
Pam: Yes. He was a good spy.
Kevin: Yeah. He was the best. James Bond would love this cupcake.
Todd Packer: Hey, you know what? It was, uh, great to see you all again. Take care. [exits]
Todd Packer: I am going through a twelve-step program. I'm currently on step zero. Which is have a [expletive] of fun. I spent six hours carefully removing the frosting and then layering in a variety of drugs, some legal, some not. Some laxative, some constipating. You don't fire the Pac-Man and expect to get away with it.
Pam: Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!
Angela: What, Pam?
Pam: [as others eat] Wait!
Angela: He's gone. It's just a cupcake now.
Pam: No, no. It's the principle of the thing.
Andy: [exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?
Angela: Kevin?
Kevin: [after long choking and refusing help from Meredith] Oh, that was fantastic.
Cameron: [after following Dwight to the chicken coop, before sunrise] Is it dangerous to take the eggs in front of them?
Dwight: Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
Cameron: I was just asking you something I didn't know.
Dwight: Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Cameron: [after grabbing an egg] Are we gonna eat these today?
Dwight: If you want.
Cameron: Is that a guillotine?
Dwight: This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
Cameron: [referencing goat] That's a cow?
Dwight: Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
Cameron: [after seeing Dwight smelling milk] What are you doing now?
Dwight: Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Cameron: I don't know.
Dwight: Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
Cameron: I don't know any of that.
Dwight: OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
Cameron: I never met him.
Pam: Good morning, Erin.
Erin: [looking disheveled] Hey.
Pam: Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.
Phyllis: I don't care what you do, Pam. Just please stop making noise.
Pam: Phyllis!
Clark: Packer laced the cupcakes.
Pam: No!
Meredith: Did you get diarrhea or were you stoned?
Angela: Some of us got both. [raises hand]
Pam: Oh my god! Is everyone OK?
Phyllis: Last night, I got out all of my old dolls and played with them on the living room floor. Then, I ordered ten American Girl outfits online. It was thousands of dollars.
Nellie: Yeah? Well, count yourself lucky, Phyllis. I got the toilet.
Stanley: Me too. [holds up four fingers]
Clark: I went Christmas caroling in March and I fertilized some bushes along the way. So, not my best night. But, not my worst night.
Phyllis: What did you do, Andy?
Andy: Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?
Kevin: Why would you ask me?
Andy: I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.
Kevin: [he and Andy embrace each other in tears] My night was just like that. [cuts to him and Andy trading clothes] Meaning normal.
Andy: Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin]
Kevin: Nope. I did not see you either.
Pam: Wow. He is officially the worst human being.
Kevin: [as Pam attempts to throw cupcake away] Ah. [stops Pam and takes cupcake]
Pam: But, Kevin that's...
Kevin: Yeah. No, I understand, Pam. I understand.
Angela: [shaking head in disbelief] No.
Todd Packer: So, that's it. I just wanted to make amends. [slides cupcakes across table to Darryl and Jim]
Darryl: That's big of you, man. Takes a lot of courage.
Jim: Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.
Todd Packer: It's OK. I'm over it.
Jeb: Oof. This is no nine-acre worm farm. This is a beast. Whoever's managing this thing is gonna have a hell of a job. Not it.
Fannie: Not it.
Dwight: It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
Fannie: All right.
Kevin: Uh oh. She's doing it again.
Pam: Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...
Clark: It's porn.
Pam: Yeah.
Dwight: [Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.
Phyllis: Why?
Darryl: Somebody just needs to get her attention, tell her it's not OK to do this in public.
Pam: Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.
Meredith: Just ignore her. Sooner or later she'll finish.
Group: Ugh. Ew.
Andy: What?
Dwight: Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.
Angela: Can we skip the color commentary and just have Andy go out there and fire her?
Toby: He- he can't do that.  Turns out she's allowed to have feelings of sexual arousal.  It doesn't become a violation until she physically acts on it.
Group: No!
Oscar: Toby, how do you propose that we-
Andy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?
Pam: She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.
Andy: Well there you go. That's muy caliente.
Dwight: OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]
Phyllis: What the hell?!
Dwight: It's OK guys, she's no longer horny.
Andy: Excuse me, dirty birdie [takes Phyllis' iPod]
Phyllis: Wait, what?
Andy: You can have this back at the end of the day.  [cut to Andy listening to the iPod and looking aroused, water is dumped on him] Oh!!
Dwight: Clark, I need your advice. I'm having some lady troubles.
Clark: What's her name?
Dwight: Esther Ruger. [Angela makes a face in the background]
Clark: Sweet.
Dwight: Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
Clark: Oh yeah. Keep talkin'.
Dwight: Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me.
Clark: Oh.
Dwight: [laughs] What do you think?
Clark: The same thing that you think.
Dwight: A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship.
Clark: God, one of my buddies is going through the same thing right now. Something in the air.
Angela: Here you go. And good for you Dwight, I'm so glad you found someone. I bet she's got kind eyes.
Angela: Dwight is dating a brussel sprout farmer named Esther.  She's coming here this afternoon with her father.  Who knows? Maybe she'll be pulling the horse cart! [laughs]
Pam: [on phone] Cici has been calling me 'Pamela'. Like four times this week.
Jim: Oh man. [laughs]
Pam: I wonder if she'll start calling you 'Jim'.
Jim: Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen.
Pam: [laughs] Um.
Jim: What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Pam: You're- You know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today. With Ryan Howard. How did that happen?
Jim: Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman.
Pam: Oh, oh OK.
Jim: Yeah, yeah. Exactly.
Pam: [sighs] Um, Ok. Well?
Jim: Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
Pam: Yeah, sounds good. Ok.
Jim: Ok great.
Pam: Ok.
Jim: Bye.
Pam: Bye.
Kevin: [Meredith laughs] What's going on? Oh, did Gangnam Style put out a new song?
Oscar: There's a promo for the new documentary on the web.
Phyllis: Play it again.
Promo Voice: [Music begins, Michael Scott is shown] The boss. [Pam and Dwight are shown in episodes past] The workers. [Ryan and Michael are shown] The lives. [Jim and Pam and Dwight and Angela are shown] The loves. [More flashback clips] The people. The paper. The Office: An American Workplace. Coming soon on WVIA.
Kevin: Whoa. You go to the bathroom for 45 minutes and everything changes.
Kevin: This is a documentary? Oh, I always thought we were like specimens in a human zoo.
Kevin: [Angela is rewatching the promo and looks nervous about the part with her and Dwight] Did you see this? [lifts monitor in her direction]
Angela: Your screen is all black. You just unplugged your computer.
Clark: [Pam smiles as she watches the promo with her and Jim on the roof] Oh my god, is that you and Jim?
Pam: Uh huh.
Clark: Jeez, you fell in love with that hair? Really? [laughs] Yikes. That is awful.
Pam: It wasn't so bad.
Andy: Guys, are you reading the online comments? Somebody commented on my banjo playing. 'Banjo at 0:19 is aight' Internet, calm down! I must be really connected with this guy.  I mean that's the guy's name, right? ChobbleGobbler?
Jim: Hey man, how you doin'? Jim Halpert.
Ryan Howard: Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh.
Darryl: Hey, man. Darryl.
Ryan Howard: Hey there, Ryan. Nice to meet you. Eat Fresh. [to camera] Eat Fresh.
Jim: Let's go to the conference room.
Dwight: Esther's on her way up. I wonder if she wants a snack. Let's see, I know she likes apples and carrots.
Angela: I bet she does.  I bet she'll eat them right out of your hand with those big strong teeth.
Dwight: Did I tell you about her teeth?
Erin: Hey Dwight, you have some guests. I think they're from the forest where we harvest our paper.
Angela: Yes.
Dwight: Ah, the Ruger family. Welcome.
Mr. Ruger: Fine office you have here. Sturdy walls.
Dwight: Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always.
Esther: Thank you. [Dwight kisses her forehead]
Angela: I guess men find Esther attractive.  I mean if there are chubby chasers, then there are men that like that....thing.
Pam: Weird to see how we used to look in those promos. Some of us have changed so much.
Stanley: [eating soft pretzel] We've all changed.
Jim: With our firm, you'll be building equity for long after they've retired your number.
Darryl: And we all know, baseball does not last forever.
Ryan Howard: I look at these actors on TV and I think: 'C'mon, I can do that.'
Jim: Right? [laughs]
Ryan Howard: Watch this: Eat Fresh. Now what does that make you think of?
Darryl: Subway sandwiches.
Jim: Yep.
Ryan Howard: How? I didn't say Subway sandwiches. It's called playing the subtext.
Jim: Wow.
Ryan Howard: I actually wrote a screenplay, it's called 'The Big Piece'
Jim: Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical.
Ryan Howard: Half biopic and half superhero movie.  A mild mannered professional baseball player, Ryan Howard-
Jim: OK
Ryan Howard: -hits a home run into outer space. Ball comes back with space dust on it, which transforms him into: The Big Piece.
Darryl: The space dust does it.
Jim: Space dust.
Darryl: Yeah.
Ryan Howard: I actually brought a- some copies of my script if you guys wanna read it together.
Jim: Sure, yeah. [laughs] Hollywood. [Ryan Howard pulls out 3 thick scripts] Alright.
Darryl: Wow. Yeah, we gonna read it.
Jim: Ok, great.
Kevin: Andy, are there documentary groupies?
Andy: Of course there are!
Kevin: Of course.
Toby: A little ironic that I'm going to be kind of a TV star, because my last Chad Flendermen novel [groups groans] was based on a murdered TV star. The small screen-
Nellie: Oh, I don't care.
Oscar: Hey guys, I just found another promo. It's in Danish. I guess it's gonna start airing in Denmark.
Pam: Oh my god!
Promo Announcer: [Speaks Danish]
Kevin: What was that word they said when they showed me 'Skrald mand'? What's that mean in Danish? Cool guy? [Oscar looks it up]
Oscar: Dumpster Man.
Kevin: Cool. Superhero.
Angela: What about me? 'Klokken tre pige'
Oscar: 'Three PM Girl'
Angela: What? Why would they...wait a second, wait a second! What was that? [pauses on her and Dwight leaving the warehouse area where they've just had sex] Oh! I didn't know they were filming then!
Oscar: It looks like the camera man was hiding behind the shelves.
Phyllis: Wait. So they were filming all the time? Even when we didn't know it?
Angela: Oh my god. [All look at camera horrified]
Angela: There was much more secret filming than I expected. [laughs] But I am fine with it, I mean it. I am.
Oscar: Are you kidding me? It's like half the show is secret footage.
Meredith: I am a very private person. I show 'em when I wanna show 'em. Who wants a taste? [lifts shirt to flash camera] Boob sauce!
Group: No!
Oscar: Meredith!
Angela: Come on!
Nellie: Oh my god. Do they film us at night when we're sleeping?
Oscar: Yes, Erin. They film us at night when we're sleeping. Cause that makes great TV!
Erin: Hey.
Angela: Oscar.
Oscar: I'm sorry sweetie. This whole thing is just freaking me out.
Oscar: I have been very honest with you guys.  In a way that could seriously impact the political career of a very good friend of mine.  You're not going to use any of that, are you?
Andy: People, relax! We are killing it online. Have you guys checked the comments? SmokeThatSkinwagon says: 'You guys are killing it!' I mean, we're internet sensations guys!
Angela: I think we need to figure out what's going on. I might just take a little walk.
Stanley: Yes, a little walk sounds like a good idea. [groups moves to warehouse and you can hear Erin whispering something]
Oscar: Ok everyone, turn off your mikes.
Angela: We need to know more. Did their shots have sound? What exactly did they get on tape?
Erin: I sneezed into my hands without using Purell and then dipped into the candy jar.  Did they film that?
Nellie: My first week here I sneezed directly into the candy jar because I thought I'd get more [Angela and Oscar make disgusted faces] I thought I'd get more screen time than anyone.
Pete: Ok, Pam. Why don't you visit your buddy, the crew guy that got fired? Find out what they got.
Pam: Brian?
Pete: Yeah.
Pam: Yeah, I guess I could.
Stanley: Hurry Pam, I need to know how much hellfire is going to rain down on me.
Phyllis: I thought Terry knew about Cynthia?
Stanley: She does. But neither of them know about Lydia.
Group: Oh!
Meredith: Wow.
Clark: Whoa! Whoa! OK, so what's this lever do?
Ruger Sister 1: That manipulates the secondary shaft.
Clark: Oh, the secondary shaft. Eeeh, oooga! [laughs]
Salesmen: The lift capacity's up at two thousand pounds. That's a lot of beets.
Mr. Ruger: Let's talk terms. If you agree to a forty sixty split on this tractor, I'll store it in one of my barns.
Dwight: Mr. Ruger, are you trying to take advantage of me because I'm interested in your daughter? Fifty fifty split or no deal.
Mr. Ruger: Esther, get in the truck.
Dwight: Ok ok ok, wait! You win. [shakes hands]
Salesman: Let's get the paperwork started.
Ruger Sister 2: We should buy an auger together.
Clark: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Ruger Sister 1: You would be a great one to buy an auger with.
Stanley: [on phone] Hello, honey? I just spoke to the TV repair man, he says we need to keep our TVs turned off for a couple of months. Something about the wiring.
Andy: Oh! Seven new comments. 'The guy at 0:19 is hawt!' [typing] 'Hi Bongripper, it's me, Andy. The guy from 0:19, I'm glad that you enjoyed my work in that promo. I really enjoyed your comment, going to read some more comments now. Have a great day!'[reading] 'He's not hawt, he's gay.' [typing] 'Dear JasonJasonJason, it's me, Andy. Nice name. Not! Guess what? I'm not gay! So you are an IDIOT. And I am hawt, according to people on this site who have a brain. Never comment on this page ever again.' [reading] 'He is hawt!' See, thank you, that's more like it. 'He is butt.' God dammit! I'm about to lose my FREAKING MIND! Screw you TexasPoonTappa! Uh!
Dwight: Security deposit. That's been-
Mr. Ruger: Standard.
Dwight: Right, standard.
Clark: Hey, can I talk to you for one second?
Dwight: No.
Clark: One second.
Dwight: No.
Clark: One second.
Dwight: I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate.
Clark: Don't do it. [takes Dwight's pen]
Dwight: What? Don't you cap that pen. Do not cap that pen! Do not! Ugh! You capped it. Wow. You are serious. Ok, you've got two minutes and then the cap comes off.
Clark: Dude, we're being conned.
Dwight: Go on.
Clark: These chicks are way too hot to be into us.  Esther's just pretending to like you so that you'll buy her daddy a new tractor.
Dwight: No.
Clark: Yes. Her sister's trying to seduce me into buying an auger with her.
Dwight: What? Has the warranty expired on the auger you have now?
Clark: I don't even know what an auger is!
Dwight: No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is.
Mr. Ruger: Hey, you ready to sign?
Dwight: I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me. [grabs Clark]
Brian: Oh, hey!
Pam: Hey!
Brian: Hi. [laughs]
Pam: Hi, um. I'm sorry, do you have a minute? Is this a bad time?
Brian: No, no, please, yeah, come on in. It's good to see you. Sorry, my place is usually not this-
Pam: Oh my gosh, please, don't.
Brian: Yeah, no, I- actually it's always like this. [laughs] Do you want to go outside? It's a little less cluttered out there.
Pam: Sure, yeah. Yeah.
Brian: Let me grab a couple drinks.
Pam: OK. [Goes out onto terrace] Oh wow, you have a nice view.
Brian: Alright, that's for you. [hands her beer]
Pam: Oh, thank you.
Brian: Cheers.
Pam: Cheers.
Angela: [Plays boom box to drown out sound] Alright, how much have you revealed on camera about your relationship with the senator?
Oscar: They caught us kissing on Halloween.
Angela: Oh! He was dressed like Ronald Reagan! [Slaps Oscar]
Oscar: Oh!
Angela: God!
Oscar: Angela! Well he kissed like Jack Kennedy!
Angela: Oh! [slaps him again] Stop it! Stop kissing him! Someone needs to call and warn him. This could ruin his career.
Oscar: Well, I don't like giving him bad news.
Angela: Call him!
Oscar: You call him!
Angela: Call him! [hits Oscar]
Oscar: Stop hitting me!
Angela: Call him! Call him!
Oscar: No!
Brian: So...
Pam: So..
Brian: What brings you by?
Pam: Well, the promo for the documentary aired today.
Brian: Oh yeah, that's right.
Pam: Yeah. It's kinda crazy.
Brian: Yeah, it is.
Pam: See all this like old stuff, like um, there's that shot of Jim and I up on the roof?
Brian: Oh yeah, that was, that was a good moment.
Pam: Yeah, wasn't that neat?
Brian: Yeah, it was cool.
Pam: Yeah, and there's this one when we were listening to music and it's like, it's like w were in love and we didn't even know we were in love and it's...but- Do you think Jim's changed?
Brian: Um...
Pam: I'm sorry. Did that? That was out of the blue-
Brian: No no, it's-
Pam: I just mean because you know us and you like observed us for ten years and I feel like he's- I just feel like...he's so into his work right now and....I don't know, am I crazy?
Brian: No, you're not crazy.
Pam: Well, I wish that made me feel better. Listen, so everybody saw the promos and they're kinda freaking out. [Brian laughs] Cause it seems like you got a lot of private stuff on camera-
Brian: Yeah.
Pam: You know, stuff people didn't intend for everyone to see. And they kinda want to know how much.
Brian: They want to know how much what?
Pam: How much stuff you got.
Brian: Pretty much everything.
Pam: Well yeah, but what if we turned our mike packs?
Brian: They've got parabolic mikes, they can pick you up a hundred yards away, so...no if you were around there, they got you.
Pam: So we basically had no privacy for ten years.
Brian: That's not really true, I mean-
Pam: Um...yeah, I gotta, I gotta go.
Brian: Oh no, hang on a second. Pam, I'm sorry, I- I- I can explain this so much better.
Pam: No I think you explained it.
Brian: Look, if you give me a chance I can, I- [Pam leaves] Pam.
Jim: 'Together we will win this baseball game against the evil space Yankees. Eat Fresh.'
Ryan Howard: That'll pay for the exploding helicopter.
Jim: Smart.
Ryan Howard: 'Suddenly, the evil thugs break in to the stadium.  The Big Piece hits baseballs at the evil thugs.'
Jim: 'Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.'
Ryan Howard: Come on man, sell it!
Darryl: Yeah, Jim.
Jim: [louder] 'Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks!'
Ryan Howard: Yeah, that's better. A bunch of hot women go: 'Oh yeah!'
Jim: 'Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.'
Ryan Howard: 'They kiss. It is super emotional. Like in Toy Story.'
Jim: Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends.
Darryl: It's so strong.
Ryan Howard: Keep reading then.
Jim: 'Gotta go! Darth Vader's launching a huge attack.'
Ryan Howard: Um another thing. I'm gonna need you to get me the rights to Darth Vader.
Jim: I don't know how we'd go about doing that.
Darryl: We can look into it.
Jim: We'll look into it.
Ryan Howard: We need Darth.
Jim: We gotta get him.
Darryl: We'll go after Darth then.
Jim: We're gonna go get him.
Darryl: That's what we gotta do.
Jim: We're gonna get him.
Dwight: Maybe you're right. Esther's a ten and the best I've ever done is Angela who's a nine and she rejected me.
Clark: A Scranton nine, but yeah, point taken. Hey, let's go out tonight and just score a couple fours huh? I mean there are no games with fours.
Dwight: Who needs a new tractor anyway? Maybe we're the kinda guys who end up with a tractor that's already been rode hard and put away muddy.
Clark: Screw new tractors. Guys like us, we gotta plant our seed a different way.
Dwight: By hand.
Esther: Dwight, we need to talk.
Dwight: I don't know that there's anything left for us to talk about, Esther.
Esther: Look, we're gonna have the tractor for the same amount of work days but my dad is planning on leasing it to the Vanderkirk brothers on the weekends.
Dwight: No.
Esther: So you're going to be paying more, but he's putting on ten times the miles and he's pocketing a profit behind your back.
Dwight: That snake!
Esther: You need to tell him you want a deal based on miles or he can just stick that tractor where the sun don't shine.
Dwight: That shady grove out by Willard's pond.
Esther: Mmhm.
Dwight: So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Esther: Of course. [laughs] You didn't just think I was tractor bait, did you?
Dwight: [laughs] No!
Clark: Hey Dwight, what's an auger used for?
Dwight: Post hole digging. [points and laughs with Esther]
Esther: Stupid.
Senator: [On speakerphone] You've reached Senator Robert Lipton, please leave a message. [beep]
Angela & Oscar: Hi honey!
Oscar: Oh you?
Angela: No you go. Hi honey!
Oscar: Hey, Hey Robert!
Angela: It's Angela and Oscar.
Oscar: Hey.
Angela: Just a few quick things.
Oscar: Um the documentary's going to be airing soon, and, and you look great in the promos.
Angela: Oh you look so handsome! Very presidential.
Oscar: Very much so.
Angela: Yeah.
Oscar: Absolutely.
Angela: Yeah!
Oscar: Hey, I get the sense you're gonna be outed as gay.
Angela: Yes and I cheated on you with Dwight, it looks like they got it on film. I didn't tell you about it.
Oscar: I think that's it!
Angela: I think we're good.
Oscar: Done!
Angela: Bye!
Oscar: Ok!
Angela: Love you! [Oscar hangs up] God.
Andy: [on video] Hey! TexasPoonTappa and JasonJasonJason and all the rest of you haters out there! Check this out. [plays banjo, screen types out 'you suck my nutz' from TexasPoonTappa, camera zooms out to reveal Nellie]
Nellie: Good night Andy.
Andy: Huh? Yeah, see ya. [sees comment] Oh! What?! [starts crying]
Promo Announcer: [Speaks Danish]
Pam: I hope you got sound on everything. I'd love a DVD of that. [at computer opens translator. Types in 'Elskere' which comes back as 'lovers' Pam smiles]
Stanley: [humming] What the hell? No. This is NOT happening.
Erin: Didn't you get the memo? It's Stairmageddon! [claps and opens the door to the stairwell] Come on Stanley! [claps]
Erin: Dwight is having maintenance done on the elevator today, and he was really on top of it. Weeks ago, he started the Stairmageddon Awareness campaign. The idea was to get us prepared, both mentally and physically, for a day that hopefully comes once in a 100 years. It's a' 'Mageddon!'
Erin: Come on! Come on, Stanley! Stay in it!
Stanley: [growls] I put 17 damn years into this company, and now they're making me climb Stair Mountain!
Erin: Come on! [claps]
Oscar: Our office has an unusually large number of' unusually large people.
Stanley: This is an abomination.
Erin: Come on. You got this. Here.
Oscar: So when something as routine as elevator maintenance happens, and people are forced to expend cardiovascular effort, we have to compare it to the end of time.
Andy: Red alert! Red alert! The reviews are in! I repeat, the reviews are in.
Oscar: What?
Andy: I just got a text from my brother. Scranton Times Tribune.com. There's a review of the documentary!
Phyllis: [gasps] What does it say?
Andy: I don't know, Phyllis! I just got the text and started screaming, 'Red Alert.'
Dwight: Well, the alert was already set to 'Red' because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to 'Double Red'?
Andy: I think we should.
Stanley: [drinks a 5-Hour Energy shot and groans]
Oscar: 'The Office: An American Workplace airing on PBS next month is a documentary following the employees of Scranton's own Dunder Mifflin Paper Company!'
Everyone: Whoo! [applause]
Nellie: 'In this series, which will air starting in May, we get an in-depth look at many interesting local people. There's Kevin Malone, the falstaffian accountant. Dwight Schrute, the head salesman forever chasing a manager position he will never get.'
Dwight: What does Josh McAuliffe know about the paper business? He works for a news'thing.
Nellie: 'Andy Bernard, the rudderless trust fund child-slash-middle manager, whose incompetence is emblematic of a declining American economy.'
Phyllis: Ouch. Sorry, Andy, that's-.
Andy: It's okay. [chuckles] The hell does he know?
Nellie: 'A possible explanation for his lack of career focus is his surprising musical talent.'
Andy: I want you to print that out for me.
Nellie: I will.
Andy: Now that this documentary is coming out, my days at Dunder Mifflin are probably limited. And you know what? Good. Because this is not what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be my generation's Lisa Loeb.
Erin: 'Though it mostly focuses on the daily realities of office life, a lurid subplot reveals the hypocrisy of a local public figure embroiled in a gay affair while preaching family values.'
Nellie: Oh! Which public figure?
Erin: I bet it's Katie Couric. I've been saying this for years.
Phyllis: No, I think they mean more like a politician.
Stanley: [walks into the office grunting and wheezing] You own the building. Why can't you fix the elevator in the middle of the night? Who do I look like? Jackie Joyner-Kersee?
Dwight: Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We could've met in the lobby. It's time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
Stanley: Son, you've lost your mind. I'm not going anywhere until you fix my elevator.
Dwight: The buyer is your sister's friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and that's an order.
Stanley: You are not my damn boss and you never will be! Guess what? Never gonna happen! Pete! Iced tea. Three sugars, five creams.
Pete: Your morning 3-by-5. Coming right up.
Pam: Well, we won't be late. I love you, mom. Thanks.
Nellie: Oh, your mom's watching the kids tonight. So what are you two up to? [chuckles] Oh, um, Embassy Suites. 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. Mommy and Daddy are on the floor.
Pam: [laughs] I wish.
Nellie: [chuckles] What, then?
Pam: Oh, nothing that exciting.
Nellie: Marriage counseling?
Pam: Hmm.
Nellie: Did you know that is the only kind of counseling I have never had?
Pam: You know, Jim's kind of nervous about it, but I think it could really help.
Nellie: Mmm.
Pam: I mean, we've having issues. It can't hurt to talk about them, right?
Jim: Hey, Toby. Um, I wanted to ask you a question.
Toby: Oh, sure.
Jim: It's a little, uh, personal.
Toby: Let's do it. Let's get personal.
Jim: I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Toby: Whoa.
Jim: Sorry. I'no, no, no, what I meant'what I meant actually was'
Toby: Oh, yeah, no, it's okay. I can handle it. Um, so'
Jim: You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Toby: [chuckles, snorts]
Jim: Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couple's counseling.
Toby: Oh, sure, lots of times. Yeah. Wait, you and Pam aren't in couple's counseling, are you? Oh, God.
Jim: No, no, no, no, no. Uh, we're just starting couple's counseling. Uh, which doesn't sound any better.
Toby: Oh, you guys. Kelly called it. 2013. So s'hey! Hey! Hey, no! No! Get outta here. Clark, get outta here.
Clark: My mistake.
Toby: Yes, it is your mistake. He's lingering. So annoying. I'm gonna kill him. How can I help? I'm here.
Jim: That's all right.
Andy: Hello, William Morris Agency. I need to speak with your best agent who represents your biggest stars. Yes, I'll hold. I'm sorry. I misunderstood. Goodbye. [hangs up phone]
Angela: Thank you, Stan. Oh, honey. [Stan��closes limo door]��Look, I just want our life to get back to normal. Ribbon cuttings, charity balls.
Robert: Don't worry. I've scheduled a press conference for later today. We just need to face the camera together. A beloved public servant and his devoted wife. And move on.
Angela: All right, if I have to be the good wife, I'll be the best damn wife there is. Correction. Best darn wife. Sorry, I'm a better wife than that. [sighs]
Dwight: Andy'[knocks] I need to talk to you.
Andy: Yeah, come on in. I'm just on hold with another talent agency. It's insane. This promo with me playing banjo has 250 views already. And every time I click, there's more. 251. 252. I can't even keep up!
Dwight: Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Andy: [grunts intensely] I hate people! Why do they never do what you need them to do? Stanley has to go. That's final.
Dwight: So what I'm hearing you say is, 'Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible'?
Andy: Yes! I'm sorry I'm being curt, it's just I'm about to land a top talent agent.
Dwight: Mm-hmm. Good luck.
Andy: [on the phone] Directory? Movie Star department. Back. Directory.
Dwight: For five years I've held my instincts in check because I wanted to be made manager. Maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go. It's kind of painful, but it's also freeing in a way. Now it's all about my instincts.
Clark: Hey, Dwight.
Dwight: Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
Stanley: Pass.
Clark: Hey, c-c-can you just let me out of here before whatever comes next?
Dwight: Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
Stanley: Dwight, you do not learn, do you? For a threat to be credible, you ha'
Dwight: [fires tranquilizer gun at Stanley]
Clark: Holy [bleep].
Stanley: No, you didn't. Sick of you and your'ooh'
Dwight: [fires tranquilizer gun twice]
Stanley: [falls to the floor with a loud thud]
Dwight: It's all right. Andy approved it.
Meredith: Man, he's really in twinkle town now.
Clark: Is he gonna be okay? I mean, weren't those darts intended for an animal, like, two to three times larger than him?
Dwight: Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanley's got way more body fat than they do.
Clark: You gave him three shots.
Dwight: Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to. [claps] Grab his feet. [grunts] Let's go!
Clark: All right.
Dwight: Move it! One, two, three. [grunts]
Dwight: He's like a manatee. Ready? Let's go again. Come on. We can do this. One, two, three! [Stanley's head hits the door frame] Oh, God.�� No wonder my elevator cables are under such strain.
Clark: We gotta get a wheelbarrow or something.
Dwight: Yes.
Dwight: [grunts] Okay, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Push!
Clark: I am!
Clark: Any good weekend plans?
Dwight: I might see a movie.
Clark: Nice.
Dwight: What about you?
Clark: Uh, I don't know yet.
Dwight: [grunts] Let's take him'
Clark: I was thinking about'
Dwight: Let's go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Clark: And then what?
Dwight: Okay, listen. I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but I've never actually done this before.
Clark: Well, if I may, you're a natural.
Dwight: Thank you. I mean, I've rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh'
Clark: That's a little weird.
Dwight: I know. Evel Knievel.
Dwight: [wraps tape around Stanley's body]
Clark: [connect helmet straps around Stanley's head] That's about as good as that's gonna be.
Dwight: Okay, now here's the plan. I'm gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Clark: Catch?
Dwight: Yeah.
Clark: I can't catch him. He's like, 250 pounds.
Dwight: You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? He's gonna be moving slowly. It's only'
Clark: Blunt?
Dwight: It's 15 feet down, it's at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, it's like your catching a medicine'
Clark: Dude, this size of my haunches' [Stanley's body slips down the stairs and his head thumps into a wall]
Dwight: Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Clark: We should probably call a doctor or something, dude.
Dwight: [slides down the stairs and lands next to Stanley] You okay?
Jim: So how does it work? It's like, you know, the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam, or'
Toby: You're really there to talk to each other. I would say that the therapist is more of a facilitator.
Jim: Mm-hmm.
Toby: He might start by asking each of you, 'Why do you think you're here?'
Pam: He took this job in Philly without telling me. He bought our house without telling me. At a certain point, he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that.
Jim: If I didn't do certain things without telling Pam, she'd be married to Roy. [chuckles]
Pam: I feel like he's always making these decisions for the family, and then I'm left playing catch-up.
Jim: If she can just hang on for a little while longer, I'this will be so huge for our family.
Toby: Well, what's a little while?
Jim: What do you mean?
Toby: I mean, what's the end date? It must be really hard for her to sign on to be unhappy if she doesn't know when it's gonna end.
Jim: That's kind of an impossible question.
Erin: Oh, guys, it's starting! Hurry!
Kevin: Ooh, there's Angela! I work with her!
Andy: Huh, yeah. [chuckles] I mean, I'm happy Angela's the first one getting famous, but it's a little weird, no? I mean, she can't sing or act, so it's actually kind of insane, if you think about it.
Phyllis: Her hair looks beautiful.
Andy: Yeah, we get it, Phyllis, she looks like a freakin' movie star! [kicks trash can]
Erin: Andy!
Robert: [on the computer screen] I would just to start by saying that there have been some rumors about my personal life that I would like to settle once and for all. As my long-suffering wife can attest' I am gay.
Crowd: [surprised chatter]
Reporter #1: Senator, were always gay, or did your wife turn you gay?
Reporter #2: Question for the Senator's beard.
Robert: [on the computer screen] I'll say it again for mis amigos latinos. Yo soy homosexual.
Pete: Poor Angela.
Phyllis: Yeah. Poor Angela.
Robert: I once believed that a gay person could be somewhat straight. It wasn't until my marriage to Angela that I realized how'charmless I find the female body.
Meredith: Oof. Always hurts to hear that one.
Robert: There's someone else I need to thank. His name is Oscar Martinez.
Andy: Come on!
Robert: Oscar is the one who opened my eyes to who I really am. For the first time'
Erin: Oscar is with the Senator too?
Kevin: Yes! And I knew it the whole time! I kept the secret. I kept the secret so good. You didn't know, you didn't know, and you didn't freaking know. But I knew! [claps]
Oscar: He knew!
Kevin: Yes, we did it!
Oscar: You did it, Kevin.
Kevin: Yes! Ohh! I did it. Ohh, I did it.
Robert: --with this new self-awareness, I was finally able to find love at long last. With my amazing' Chief of Staff Wesley Silver.
Oscar: What?!
Creed: Wesley Silver's gay?
Crowd: [surprised chatter]
Angela: [gasps]
Kevin: Ohh.
Creed: They make a nice couple.
Angela: [gags]
Dwight: Almost there. Almost there. [opens car door] Okay. We're running late. Let's get him inside.
Clark: We can't just leave him bubble wrapped like this.
Dwight: Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Clark: That's actually really smart.
Dwight: Thank you.
Clark: God, if only there was any other use or situation for that kind of knowledge.
Dwight: Let's get him inside.
Andy: Carla Fern is not just an actor's agent. She does writers, directors, travel, and real estate.
Andy: Actor?
Man: Oh, no. [chuckles] Well, I have an act. Dog, cat, mouse.
Andy: Yeah, wow, cool. Is it hard to train them to do that?
Man: Eh, you go through a lot of mice.
Man: If started by accident as these things tend to do. You know, I was setting down my cat, and I accidently put her on top of my dog, and I was, like, so mad at myself at first. And then I was, like, wait. Wait a second.
Andy: Does anything go on top of the mouse?
Man: Yeah. Little hat.
Andy: Aw, that's cute.
Man: Yeah.
Andy: What's the mouse's name?
Man: Eh, you know, it really doesn't make sense to name the mice. They're kinda like cannon fodder, you know? You're not one of those PETA guys , are you? [cat jumps off dog] Oh, great.
Clark: Hey, wait, wait, how'how are we doing this?
Dwight: Well, I'll grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Clark: Just say 'arms' and 'legs,' okay? That just'that's the vernacular that I'm comfortable with.
Dwight: Fine, let's go. [grunts]
Clark: [sighs]
Dwight: Hoist his shank on three.
Clark: Wha'What's a shank?
Dwight: It's by the tenderloin.
Dwight: Roll him, roll him, roll him. Good. Good. Okay, careful, he's slouching. Okay, can you'sl-slouch him into the seat. [sighs] Here. Here. Go around and get his seatbelt. [grunts]
Clark: All right.
Dwight: Got it?
Clark: Yeah'yup yup.
Dwight: [grunts and closes car door] Get in the back.
Clark: What?
Dwight: Get in the back.
Clark: Aw, come on.
Dwight: Get in.
Clark: Damn it.
Dwight: Okay, Stanley? Do you understand what we're about to do?
Stanley: Helllloooo!
Clark: Okay. We, hey'hey, listen, listen. We are going to go discuss paper contracts for city of Lackawanna public schools, okay?
Stanley: Pigeons.
Dwight: Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like we've got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Clark: Isn't the client, like, best friends with his sister?
Dwight: New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Let's go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Let's go.
Pam: I'm sure Athlead will be a huge success. But I don't want him to do it anymore, and I don't want to give him an ultimatum, but I am not moving our family to Philly.
Jim: Well, if Pam says she won't go, then'[chuckles] we're gonna need a lot more than counseling. Hmph.
Nellie: That was exhausting.
Toby: Blah blah blah blah. Jim.
Nellie: Well, they deserve each other, then.
Toby: They do. That they do.
Nellie: That is for sure.
Toby: [whispers] That they do.
Dwight: And for'oh, whoopsie daisy. [chuckles]
Mrs. Davis: Stanley, what is going on here?
Dwight: He's fine. He gets carsick really easily.
Clark: Driving.
Dwight: It's a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now we're talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Stanley: Ooh-hoo, look at that baby'
Dwight: Stanley.
Stanley: Ohhh'
Mrs. Davis: That's Benji in the middle.
Stanley: That's Benji. Oh, he's precious. That's a healthy-looking baby.
Mrs. Davis: Very special little boy.
Dwight: Look at him. I've never seen such a beautiful child.
Mrs. Davis: Funny sense of humor. If you push on his nose, he'll go, 'eee.'
Dwight: Like this? Watch.
Stanley: Eee.
Everyone: [laughs]
Mrs. Davis: Like that.
Stanley: A beautiful family.
Dwight: [laughs] Right? Come on!
Dwight: Yeah, maybe I'll never be manager, but I just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients, and I must say, it's the most pleasant I've ever seen Stanley. I think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis.
Carla: So, what can you do?
Andy: [Australian accent] Well, what can't I do? Right, I can sing, I can dance, I can play the banjo, innit? And if you hadn't noticed, I've got a pretty good British accent.
Carla: Can you drive a car?
Andy: At the risk of sounding arrogant, I did drive myself here.
Carla: Why do you have, uh, a high school musical here on your resume? What are you, like, 40? 45?
Andy: My exact age is 28 to 34, so basically just send me out on whatever Jake Gyllenhaal's going out on.
Carla: Gyllenhaal, got it. Can you juggle and crap?
Andy: : Yes. And yes. [chuckles]
Carla: Would you dress up as, say, a birthday clown and go to a kid's party, let 'em throw pies at ya?
Andy: Whereas that is not why I have entered show business, I do understand that you have to build credibility. [sniffs] I'm all for it.
Carla: Well, Mr. Bernard, I'm gonna be honest with you.
Andy: Well, at least I tried. Thank you very much.
Carla: Uh, no. We're'we're gonna take you on as a client.
Andy: You are? Yes! Yes. Are you being for real right now? Oh, man. Ah, yes! I need this so bad. I really think this is what could fix me.
Carla: We are extremely excited to be working with you too, sir. Pay Todd on your way out.
Andy: Most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you, but with Carla you pay a flat rate of $5,000 up front. And that includes headshots.
Todd: Uh, it doesn't include headshots.
Andy: It doesn't include headshots.
Todd: No.
Andy: Well, of course not, because that would be insane if it did. Still getting a bargain, though.
Stanley: So I just smiled and complimented her grandkids, and we closed it?
Dwight: You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didn't even know it. I'll go tell Andy the good news. Oh. [chuckles] Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
Stanley: Oh, no, I'm not doing that again. You got me down, you gotta get me back up.
Dwight: Well'no, no'n'
Stanley: [stabs his own leg with a tranquilizer dart and falls to the ground]
Dwight: [stomps on the ground] We need a winch and a hoist.
